def solve(input_matrix):
    """
    This function takes an input matrix, a two-dimensional list, and returns another two-dimensional list where 
    the order of the rows in the input matrix is reversed in the output. The function does not consider any specifics 
    of the data in the rows, so it should work for any set of input colors/IDs.
    
    Arguments:
    input_matrix -- a two-dimensional list, representing a grid or matrix, where each item (a row) is also a list.

    Returns:
    The same two-dimensional list where rows are in reverse order.
    
    How this function works:
    This function makes use of Python's list slicing to reverse the order of the rows. 
    The slicing operation [::-1] returns a new list that is a reversed copy of the original.
    The reversed list is then returned as the result.
    Since the problem seems to be to reverse the order of the rows in a matrix, 
    this function provides a general solution to the problem.
