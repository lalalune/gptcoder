def solve(input_matrix):
    """
    The function 'solve' receives a matrix as input and performs operations of reflections and combinations to transform it into the output matrix.
    
    It works based on a pattern found in given examples of the ARC challenge. The pattern was that the output matrix can be derived by reflecting the input grid along the vertical axis, appending it to the original grid, then reflecting this newly formed grid along the horizontal axis and appending the reflected grid to the original again.

    :param input_matrix: The input is a list of lists (2d grid), where each individual list is a row in the grid. 
                         Numbers in the lists denote different colors. Input grid has a height ≥ 1 and ≤ 10, width ≥ 1 and ≤ 10.
    
    :return: The output of the function is also a 2d grid following the transformation rule.

    Example:
    
    Input: [[0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 8, 0]]
    Output: [[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], 
             [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0],
             [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
             [0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0],
             [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]]
