def solve(matrix):
    """
    This function mirrors the input matrix along the x-axis (horizontal axis) and appends it to the original matrix.
    
    Parameters:
    matrix: 2D list of ints.
        The input matrix to be transformed.
        
    Returns:
    copy_matrix: 2D list of ints.
        The transformed version of the input matrix.
        
    The function works by creating a deep copy of the input matrix. Then for each row in the input matrix in reverse iteration,
    it appends the row to the copied matrix - effectively mirroring the original matrix along x-axis.

    This solution generalizes well to matrices of all shapes and works irrespective of the actual values in the matrices.
