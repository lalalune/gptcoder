def solve(input_matrix):
    """
    This function transforms the given input matrix following a specific set of rules and returns the transformed matrix as output.

    The function follows the pattern/rules identified from the given examples:
    - If a row in the input matrix contains more than one distinct number, every number in that row is replaced with 0.
    - If a row in the input matrix contains the exact same number, every number in that row is replaced by 5.

    Note: This function assumes that the input is a valid matrix i.e., a 2D list where each row has the same number of elements. Also, the function doesn't have any specific dependency on the "color" or "ID" values in the matrix, it just checks for equality of all elements in a row.

    Arguments:
    input_matrix : a list of list containing integers

    Returns:
    output_matrix : a list of list containing integers which is a transformation of the input_matrix following the above mentioned rules
