The outputs don't have the same shape as the inputs, and they don't appear to be somewhat edited copies of the input.

The inputs appear to consist of "noisy" segments which are either stacked on top of each other or side-by-side. In other words, they are either noisy columns or noisy rows. Each segment consists of exactly one color. These colors also appear in the output.

In two of the example inputs (inputs 2 and 3), there are horizontal segments (rows) which are stacked on top of each other. The outputs for these inputs are each single columns. The color of each cell in the output column is the color of the corresponding segment in the input.

In the other example input (input 1), there are vertical segments (columns) which are stacked side-by-side. The output for this input is a single row. The color of each cell in the output row is the color of the corresponding segment in the input.

In the additional input, there are vertical segments (columns) which are stacked side-by-side. This input matches the "noisy" segment pattern of the other inputs.

The transformation rule appears to be to identify the colors of the segments and then to stack them side-by-side if they are columns or on top of each other if they are rows.

My code will first need to determine if the input consists of column segments or row segments. Then, it will need to identify the colors of the segments and stack them side-by-side or on top of each other as appropriate.

How can I determine if the input consists of column segments or row segments? Inputs which consist of column segments don't necessarily have the same color in each literal column of the grid as it is "noisy". However, they do always have the same color in the leftmost (or rightmost) column. Otherwise, the leftmost (or rightmost) segment wouldn't be contiguous. Similarly, inputs which consist of row segments don't necessarily have the same color in each literal row of the grid as it is "noisy". However, they do always have the same color in the topmost (or bottommost) row.

So, to identify if the input consists of column segments or row segments, I can check if all of the cells in the leftmost column have the same color. If they do, then the input consists of column segments. Otherwise, the input consists of row segments.

I need to know the colors of the segments (in order). I know that the segments are contiguous. So, I can take any row/column which includes all of the segments and then deduplicate the colors in that row/column. The resulting list of colors will be the colors of the segments (in order). If the input consists of column segments, then I want to look at a row/column which will intersect with all of these segments. So, in the case of column segments, I want to look at any row. I'll use the top row. If the input consists of row segments, then I want to look at a row/column which will intersect with all of these segments. So, in the case of row segments, I want to look at any column. I'll use the left column.

I'll use numpy in the code to make it easier to work with the grid.

The code should:

- Identify if the input consists of column segments or row segments. This can be done by checking if all of the cells in the leftmost column have the same color.
- Identify the colors of the segments (in order). This can be done by looking at the top row if the input consists of column segments and by looking at the left column if the input consists of row segments.
- If the input is columns, return a single row where each cell is the color of the corresponding segment. If the input is rows, return a single column where each cell is the color of the corresponding segment.

I'll now write the code.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the change from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples. I'll also describe the input for each example as seems relevant.

In example 1, a teal (color 8) 2x2 square is removed from around the bottom left. The output contains a teal 2x2 square in a different position, so it appears as though the square has been moved. It was moved to the top left. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey (color 5) outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the teal 2x2 square used to be black (color 0) in the original input. The teal 2x2 square exactly matches the black 2x2 square that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. A fuchsia (color 6) 1x2 rectangle was removed from the top right. The output contains a fuchsia 1x2 rectangle in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the bottom right. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the fuchsia 1x2 rectangle used to be black in the original input. The fuchsia 1x2 rectangle exactly matches the black 1x2 rectangle that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. The rest of the cells in the input are unchanged, including a number of orange (color 7) cells.

In example 2, a green (color 3) L shape is removed from the middle left. The output contains a green L in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the top left. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the green L used to be black in the original input. The green L exactly matches the black L that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. A brown (color 9) rectangle was removed from the top right. The output contains a brown rectangle in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the bottom right. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the brown rectangle used to be black in the original input. The brown rectangle exactly matches the black rectangle that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. The rest of the cells in the input are unchanged, including a number of fuchsia cells.

In example 3, a purple (color 2) shape is removed from the top left. The output contains the same purple shape in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the bottom left. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the purple shape used to be black in the original input. The purple shape exactly matches the black shape that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. A teal (color 8) shape was removed from the bottom right. The output contains a teal shape in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the top right. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the teal shape used to be black in the original input. The teal shape exactly matches the black shape that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. The rest of the cells in the input are unchanged, including a number of yellow (color 4) cells.

The transformation rule appears to be to take whichever shapes can be used to fill in the gaps in the grey outlines and then move those shapes into the grey outlines. The colored shapes are removed from the old locations (replaced with black) and then the gap is filled in with the corresponding color. This is done while leaving everything else as is.

I should check this proposed rule and make sure it is unambiguous. Are there ever any cases where a different shape could have fit inside the grey outline? I should check example by example.

In example 1, are there any 2x2 squares other than the teal square? No. Are there any 1x2 rectangles other than the fuchsia rectangle? Yes, there is an orange 1x2 rectangle. So, the proposed rule is ambiguous in this case.

So, the rule can't just be to take any shape which fits in the grey outline and move it into the grey outline. I should analyze what's going on with the cells which aren't moved. The cells which aren't moved in example 1 are orange. There are multiple discontinuous orange cells while the teal and fuchsia shapes are unique and contiguous. So, the rule could be to move the contiguous shapes which have a unique color into the outline where they fit. I need to check this rule in the other examples. In example 2, the green and brown shapes are unique and contiguous while the fuchsia cells have multiple discontinuous groups. In example 3, the purple and teal shapes are unique and contiguous while the yellow cells are not. In the additional input, there is a unique orange shape and a unique yellow shape while there are multiple discontinuous groups of purple cells. There are exactly two gaps in the grey outlines. So, this rule is unambiguous here as well.

Ok, I now understand the rule. I need to identify the contiguous shapes which have a unique color and then move them into the corresponding void grey outline.

To implement this, I will:

1. Identify each grey outline. I can do this by finding all of the grey cells and then finding the contiguous grey groupings (which should correspond to each outline). This assumes that each grey outline is disjoint from the others. Is this assumption correct? Yes, it is correct. The grey outlines are disjoint from each other.
2. For each grey outline, I will find the black cells inside of it. Each grey outline is always rectangular, so I can find the bounding box of the grey outline and then find the black cells inside of the bounding box.
3. For each black shape inside of a grey outline, I will find the contiguous shape of the same shape but of a different color. I can do this by finding all of the cells of each color and then finding the contiguous shapes of each color. I will then check if each shape is the same shape as the black shape. I also need to check that the colored shape is the unique contiguous shape of that color.
4. I will then move the colored shape into the grey outline and replace the old location of the colored shape with black.
5. I will then return the new grid.

I will now implement this in code.

I'll describe the change from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples. I'll also describe the input for each example as seems relevant.

In example 1, the teal (color 8) shape is reflected across the vertical line at the left edge of the teal shape. There is also a yellow (color 4) shape below the teal shape which is unchanged.

In example 2, the teal shape is reflected across the vertical line at the right edge of the teal shape. The teal shape is different from the teal shape in example 1. There is also a yellow shape below the teal shape which is unchanged. The yellow shape is different from the yellow shape in example 1. However, it is just the reflection of the yellow shape in example 1.

In example 3, the teal shape is reflected across the vertical line at the left edge of the teal shape. The teal shape is different from the teal shape in example 1. There is also a yellow shape below the teal shape which is unchanged. The yellow shape is the same as the yellow shape in example 1.

In the additional input, there is a teal shape and there is also a yellow shape. The teal shape is different from the teal shape in example 1. The yellow shape is the same as the yellow shape in example 2 (which isn't the same as example 1).

The rule is to reflect the teal shape across a vertical line at the edge of the teal shape. I need to determine which side of the teal shape to reflect towards. Example 2 differs from examples 1 and 3 in which side the teal shape is reflected towards. Are there any salient commonalities between examples 1 and 3 which differ from example 2? Yes, the yellow shape is the same in examples 1 and 3. The yellow shape is different in example 2. So, the orientation of the yellow shape determines which side the teal shape is reflected towards.

If the yellow shape is:
4|0|0
4|4|4
0|4|0

Then the teal shape is reflected towards the left. If the yellow shape is:
0|0|4
4|4|4
0|4|0

Then the teal shape is reflected towards the right.

The yellow shape always appears in the middle in the bottom 3 rows, so it should be easy to check what orientation it is in. Then, I just need to reflect the teal shape based on the orientation of the yellow shape. If it is the first orientation, I reflect towards the left. If it is the second orientation, I reflect towards the right.

I'll describe the change from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples. I'll also describe the input for each example as seems relevant.

In example 1, the two teal (color 8) cells are connected by a green (color 3) line. The line is horizontal and connects the two teal cells.

In example 2, the four teal cells are connected by green lines. The lines are vertical and connect the teal cells in pairs.

In example 3, the four teal cells are connected by green lines. The lines are horizontal and connect the teal cells in pairs.

In example 4, the two teal cells are connected by a green line. The line is vertical and connects the two teal cells.

In example 5, there is only one teal cell, so no green line is added.

In example 6, the two teal cells are not connected by a green line. This is because the teal cells are not aligned horizontally or vertically.

In example 7, the three teal cells are connected by a green line. The line is vertical and connects the teal cells in pairs.

In example 8, the five teal cells are connected by green lines. The lines are vertical and horizontal and connect the teal cells in pairs.

The rule is to connect the teal cells with green lines if they are aligned horizontally or vertically. If they are not aligned, no green line is added.

To implement this, I will:

1. Identify the teal cells.
2. Check which pairs of teal cells are aligned horizontally or vertically.
3. For each pair of teal cells that are aligned horizontally or vertically, add a green line connecting them. The green line should fill in the cells in between the teal cells (but should not overwrite the teal cells).
4. Return the new grid.

In example 1:

- A new brown (color 9) cell replaces one of the teal (color 8) cells on the top left corner of a teal rectangle.
- A new fuchsia (color 6) cell replaces a teal cell on the bottom left corner of the rectangle.
- A new yellow (color 4) cell replaces a teal cell on the bottom right corner of the rectangle.

The grid is otherwise unchanged.

The input for example 1:

- It has a teal rectangle in the middle.
- It has a brown cell directly above the teal rectangle.
- It has a fuchsia cell directly to the left of the teal rectangle.
- It has a yellow cell directly below the teal rectangle.
- The brown cell is directly above the new brown cell (in the same column).
- The fuchsia cell is directly to the left of the new fuchsia cell (in the same row).
- The yellow cell is directly below the new yellow cell (in the same column).

In example 2:

- A new orange (color 7) cell replaces a teal (color 8) cell on the top of the teal rectangle.
- A new fuchsia cell replaces a teal cell on the top left corner of the rectangle.
- A new purple (color 2) cell replaces a teal cell on the middle right side of the rectangle.
- A new green (color 3) cell replaces a teal cell on the bottom left corner of the rectangle.
- A new blue (color 1) cell replaces a teal cell on the bottom right corner of the rectangle.

The input for example 2:

- It has a teal rectangle in the middle.
- It has an orange cell directly above the new orange cell (in the same column).
- It has a fuchsia cell directly to the left of the new fuchsia cell (in the same row).
- It has a purple cell directly to the right of the new purple cell (in the same row).
- It has a green cell directly to the left of the new green cell (in the same row).
- It has a blue cell directly below the new blue cell (in the same column).

In example 3:

- A new yellow cell replaces a teal cell on the top left corner of the teal rectangle.
- A new fuchsia cell replaces a teal cell on the top right corner of the rectangle.
- A new purple cell replaces a teal cell on the left side of the rectangle.
- A new orange cell replaces a teal cell on the bottom left corner of the rectangle.
- A new purple cell replaces a teal cell on the bottom right corner of the rectangle. This is a different change than the prior purple cell.
- A new green cell replaces a teal cell on the left side of the rectangle.

The input for example 3:

- It has a teal pixel in the middle.
- It has a yellow/fuchsia/purple/orange/purple/green cell in the same column/row as the new cell with the matching color.

The input for the additional example:

- It has a teal rectangle in the middle.
- It has various colored pixels around the teal rectangle.

Given these observations, we can infer the transformation rule:

1. Identify a central shape (namely the teal rectangle).
2. Look for colored cells which aren't part of the central shape.
3. For each colored cell found around the central shape, replace a single cell on the edge of the central shape.
4. If the colored cell is above/below the central shape, replace the top/bottom (respectively) cell in the same column on the central shape with the colored cell.
5. If the colored cell is to the left/right of the central shape, replace the left/right cell in the same row on the central shape with the colored cell.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples to infer the transformation rule. I'll also describe the input for each example.

In example 1, the input has a purple outline forming a square with an inner black region. The output has the same purple outline but the inner region has been filled with blue. The change in this case is filling the innermost black region with blue.

In example 2, the input has a more complex purple shape with several inner black regions. The output shows that the innermost black region of a continuous block of black cells, bounded by purple cells, has been filled with blue. There is a another black region in the input in the top left corner which is surronded by purple cells but which also touches the edge of the grid. This region is not filled with blue in the output. So, the transformation seems to be to fill the black regions which are fully bounded by purple cells with blue. It doesn't count if the black region touches the edge of the grid and thus isn't fully bounded by purple cells.

In example 3, the input is a more extended purple border. The inner black regions bound by purple cells are filled with blue. There is a black region in the bottom right which borders the bottom edge of the grid. This region is not filled with blue in the output.

The transformation consists of:

1. Identifying regions fully enclosed by purple cells. (Not including regions that touch the edge of the grid.)
2. Filling the identified regions with blue (color 1).

Let's break it down into steps and ensure the analysis and transformation rules are clear:

1. **Region Identification**:
   - Identify all black regions (0) enclosed by purple cells (2).
   - Ensure the black regions do not touch the edge of the grid, since such regions are not enclosed entirely by purple cells.

2. **Filling the Regions**:
   - Replace all the cells in the correctly identified black regions with blue (1).

To efficiently find all connected components in the grid and check if they are completely enclosed by purple cells, we can use the concept of connected components using BFS or DFS and boundary checks.

**Algorithm Steps**:
1. For each black region, use BFS or DFS to explore the connected component of black cells (0).
2. Check if the boundary of the connected component only consists of purple cells (2).
3. If the component is fully enclosed by purple cells and doesn't touch the grid edges, fill it with blue (1).

Now let's implement this transformation rule in code.

The outputs don't match the shapes of the inputs. The outputs are an edited subset of the input. At least they appear to be that.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples to infer the transformation rule. I'll also describe the input for each example.

In example 1:

- The input contains two purple (color 2) rectangles.
- The input contains various yellow (color 4) cells scattered around.
- The output is the larger purple rectangle extracted but just the inside extracted and with an added yellow border around the extracted insides.

In example 2:

- The input contains two blue (color 1) rectangles.
- The input contains various green (color 3) cells scattered around.
- The output is the larger blue rectangle extracted but just the inside extracted and with an added green border around the extracted insides.

In example 3:

- The input contains three green (color 3) rectangles.
- The input contains various purple (color 2) cells scattered around.
- The output is the larger green rectangle extracted but just the inside extracted and with an added purple border around the extracted insides.

By comparing the outputs and descriptions of the inputs, the inferred transformation rule can be described as:

1. Identify the color group outlines (the rectangles).
2. Extract the cells within the largest rectangle and find the dimensions of the included area (removing the outer border).
3. Add a colored border (based on the scattered colored points inside and outside the boundary) around the identified outlined region.
4. Return the new grid.

The output images are always filled with borders that contain a single color and a colored outline.

Next, I will implement this rule in the code.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs, and the cells are essentially rearranged. Let's analyze each example to see if we can identify the systematic transformation rule.

**Example 1:**

- The columns in the input matrix have been swapped, giving a specific transformation.
- The first column in the output is the last column of the input.
- The last column in the output is the first column of the input.
- The middle columns are flipped.
- The columns are flipped over the center vertical line.

**Example 2:**

- The same pattern is observed.

**Example 3:**

- The columns are swapped again, which follows the same transformation rule derived for previous examples.

The transformation rule is to flip the columns over the center vertical line. The first column becomes the last column, the last column becomes the first column, the second column becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.

The transformation from the input to the output can be described as extracting a 3x3 grid from the input grid. This 3x3 grid is extracted from the corners of the original grid, and it retains the pattern of the corner cells, but compressed into a smaller grid format.

Upon examining the outputs more closely:

1. Observe that the input grid has a color pattern on the corners and these patterns are transferred to the corners of a 3x3 grid in the same relative positions.
2. The center of the 3x3 output is always black (0).
3. The top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right cells in the input are moved to the same positions in the 3x3 grid.
4. The adjacent pairs from the input corners are placed at the edges of the 3x3 grid.

To summarize the rule:

1. The top left 2x2 of the input grid goes to the top left corner of the output.
2. The top right 2x2 of the input grid goes to the top right corner of the output.
3. The bottom left 2x2 of the input grid goes to the bottom left corner of the output.
4. The bottom right 2x2 of the input grid goes to the bottom right corner of the output.
5. Any black cells in-between remain black in the output.

The original code is producing outputs with invalid values (invalid colors). It is also outputting colors which should not be present: in all of the examples, the correct output only contains colors which are present in the input. (And my understanding of the rule also implies that the output should only contain colors which are present in the input.)

It seems like the issue is with summing the colors. This could create invalid colors by adding up two color values and then getting an invalid color value. What should happen when multiple corner cells write to the same cell in the output grid? In cases where the assignment overlaps, the cell should be set to the color (which is not black (color 0)) if any of the corner cells which write to that cell are not black. So, I will need to check if any of the corresponding corner cells are not black before adding the color to the output grid. I can do this by changing from `+=` to `=` when assigning the colors to the output grid and also not assigning the color if the corresponding corner cell is black.

I'll quickly check that the issue is summation by verifying that some of the incorrect outputs could result from this issue. In example 1, 8+8 would be 16, which corresponds to an invalid value that we see. So addition could be the issue here. In example 2, 2+2 would be 4, which corresponds to a color which did end up in the output, but which shouldn't be present. This is consistent with the issue being with addition.

Ok, I will now fix the code by changing the `+=` to `=` and by not assigning the color if the corresponding corner cell is black.

The outputs always have a different shape than the inputs. The outputs are smaller subgrids cut out from the original larger input grids. 

I'll describe the changes for each given input and its corresponding output to infer the transformation rule:

In Example 1: 
The input is a 9x9 grid. The output is a 5x5 grid.
- The grey cells (5) are moved to the middle columns of the output grid.
- The teal (8) cells are moved to the corners of the output grid.
- There doesn't appear to be any pattern for the black (0) cells.

In Example 2: 
The input is a 9x11 grid, and the output is a 5x7 grid.
- The grey cells (5) are clustered around the vertical center line of the output grid.
- The teal (8) cells are placed in the four corners of the output grid.
- Unoccupied cells in the original locations are converted to black (0) in the output grid.

In Example 3: 
The input is an 11x13 grid, and the output is a 6x5 grid.
- The grey cells (5) are placed around center of the output grid.
- The teal cells (8) occupy the corners of the output grid.
- Black cells occupy the remaining spots.

The transformation rule appears to consistently focus on:
1. Maintaining the locations of the grey (5) cells in the vertical center or close to it.
2. Arranging the teal (8) cells in the corners of the grid
3. Keeping black cells (0) elsewhere within the bounds of the new smaller grid.

By examining the examples, the following transformation steps can be identified:
1. Identify the grey cells and their current relative positions in the vertical center.
2. Identify the teal cells to be placed in the corners.
3. Keep black cells in the remaining positions.
4. Due to the reduction in size, disregard cells which aren't part of the core subgrid focused around the grey and teal cells.

I believe I can now write a transformation script to implement this.

The primary issue with the previous implementation is that it did not correctly determine the shape of the output grid. The correct output grid shape varies depending on the input. Specifically, the output grid should reflect the placement and spacing of the grey and teal cells within the constraints of a smaller grid.

It seems like the previous implementation special cases various things in a way that won't transfer to all relevant inputs.

In the given examples, the inconsistencies point to incorrectly determining the size of the output grid and correspondingly not extracting the correct cells from the input grid.

Here's a revised approach:
1. Identify the positions of grey (5) cells.
2. Determine the bounding box for the transformed grid dimensions. In particular, the bounding box should be the minimal bounding box which surrounds the grey cells but with an additional row added above and below. (It shouldn't include any additional columns.) This is to include the teal corners.
3. Extract the corresponding bounding box from the input grid and create a new output grid with just the extracted cells.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the change from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples. I'll also describe the input for each example as seems relevant.

In example 1, each purple (color 2) cell adjacent to the grey (color 5) bar results in a grey cell being added in that row or column.

In example 2, each green (color 3) cell adjacent to the grey bar results in a grey cell being added in that row or column.

In example 3, each blue (color 1) cell adjacent to the grey bar results in a grey cell being added in that row or column.

In each example, a grey cell is added directly to the left/right or top/bottom of the corresponding colored cell in the grey bar.

The rule seems to be: for each colored cell adjacent to the grey bar, add a grey cell in the grey bar directly to the left/right or top/bottom of the corresponding colored cell. The colored cell should not be directly on the bar – it should be separated by at least one black (color 0) cell.

The transformation rule I inferred previously appears to be correct, but there is an implementation issue that caused the transformed output to include the original colored cells in the resulting grid.

Specifically, after making the edits to add the grey (color 5) cells, the colored cells themselves (e.g., purple, green, blue) should be removed. This is evidenced by the expected vs. actual outputs from example 1, example 2, and example 3: the colored cells that led to the addition of grey cells should be entirely gone from the resulting output.

Here are the refined steps to be implemented:
1. Identify the grey bar.
2. For each colored cell adjacent to the grey bar, add a grey cell to the grey bar directly adjacent to the colored cell.
3. Remove the colored cells from the grid.

This approach should ensure that no residual colored cells remain post-transformation.

I'll now fix the code by incorporating this rule to remove the colored cells after processing them.

The transformation rule I've inferred is correct, but the code implementation has an error where it sometimes misses adding a grey cell to the grey bar.

I'll examine the issue for each example.

Example 1:

- A grey cell is missing from the output.
- This missing grey cell is in the location where there was previously a purple cell in the input grid. So, this purple cell was directly beside the grey bar and should have been replaced with a grey cell in the output. It seems that the current implementation is not correctly handling the case where a colored cell is adjacent to the grey bar.

Example 2:

- There are several missing grey cells in the output.
- Some of these missing grey cells are in the locations where there were previously green cells in the input grid. These green cells were directly beside the grey bar and should have been replaced with grey cells in the output. So, this is the same issue as in example 1.
- There is also a stack of 2 grey cells pointing out (on the right side of the grey bar near the middle) and the second grey cell is missing from the output. In this case, no green cell was adjacent to the grey bar. There were two green cells in the corresponding row, so it seems like two grey cells should have been added while only one was added. This seems like a different issue from the prior issue.

Example 3:

- There are two missing grey cells in the output.
- One of these missing grey cells is in the location where there was previously a blue cell in the input grid. This blue cell was directly beside the grey bar and should have been replaced with a grey cell in the output. This is the same issue as in example 1.
- There is also a stack of 2 grey cells pointing out (on the top side of the grey bar near the middle) and the second grey cell is missing from the output. This seems like the issue I identified in example 2 with stacks.

The issues identified suggest that there are multiple problems in how I'm handling the replacement of colored cells adjacent to the grey bar:

1. **Adjacent Cell Replacement**: In some cases, the cells immediately adjacent to the grey bar are not being correctly set to grey. This could be due to conditions not properly accounting for the case in which a colored cell is directly beside the grey bar. The exact issue is that the code always sets the position of the colored cell to black, but when the colored cell is adjacent to the grey bar, this means the code first sets the cell to grey (which is correct) and then sets the same cell to black (which is incorrect). This can be fixed by only setting the cell to black if it hasn't been set to grey.
2. **Stacked Grey Cells**: When there are multiple grey cells that ought to be added in a row or column adjacent to the grey bar, the implementation is currently only adding one grey cell. The code will need to manually handle the stacking case. We can check if a grey cell has already been added in the same row or column and if so, change the position at which we add the next grey cell to be further from the grey bar.

I'll now fix the code to address these issues.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. Each example input consists of blue (color 1) pixels arranged in a rectangular path with some gaps, and the corresponding output contains the same blue pixels along with added purple (color 2) pixels in the gaps to form a continuous rectangular path.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:

- Example 1:
  - Original Input Gaps: (1, 2), (1, 9), (3, 0), (3, 10), (5, 10), (7, 4)
  - Change: Each gap is filled with purple (color 2)

- Example 2:
  - Original Input Gaps: (3, 4), (3, 10), (4, 10), (6, 4), (6, 10), (7, 2)
  - Change: Each gap is filled with purple (color 2)
  - No change for coordinates that already contain blue.

- Example 3:
  - Original Input Gaps: (4, 8), (7, 10), (9, 8), (10, 4), (10, 10)
  - Change: Each gap is filled with purple (color 2)
  - No change for coordinates that already contain blue.

The transformation rule appears to be: Fill the gaps in the rectangular path formed by blue pixels with purple (color 2) pixels to create a continuous path.

Implementation Steps:
1. Identify the blue pixels.
2. Look for gaps in the blue path.
3. Fill these gaps with purple (color 2) pixels.
4. Return the modified grid.

I'll use numpy to accomplish this.

The code must:
1. Identify cells with blue pixels.
2. Iterate through all possible gap points in the rectangular path.
3. Fill the gaps with purple (color 2) where they are found.
4. Ensure this change is general enough to work with any grid provided.

Here’s the implementation:

The implementation produced the correct output on Example 1 but failed for Examples 2 and 3.

For Example 2 and Example 3:
- There are purple pixels (2) that should be placed to complete a vertical/horizontal line that crosses between the sides of the overall blue rectangular path.
- Example 2 has a partially filled vertical line that crosses between the sides of the rectangular path. Example 2 only has one such partially filled line crossing between the sides.
- Example 3 has a partially filled horizontal line that crosses between the sides of the rectangular path. Example 3 only has one such partially filled line crossing between the sides.

The transformation rule requires filling these additional lines. So, in addition to filling the gaps in the rectangular path, we also need to fill the partially filled lines that cross between the sides of the rectangular path. Examples 2 and 3 only have one such line each. The additional input also appears to only have one such line. So, I only need to handle the potential for one such line.

The transformation rule should be:
1. Identify the rectangular path formed by blue pixels.
2. Fill the gaps in the rectangular path with purple pixels.
3. If there is a blue line that crosses between the sides of the rectangular path, fill the gaps in the line with purple pixels.

How can step 3 be implemented? We know there is only one such line. So, we can start by finding a single blue pixel that is strictly within the rectangular path. If we don't find such a pixel, there is no need to do anything. If we do find such a pixel, we need to determine if the line is a row or column. We can do this by finding another distinct blue pixel in the same row or column which is strictly within the rectangular path. Now we know whether the line is a row or column and we know where the line is (based on the first blue pixel we found). We can then fill the gaps in the line with purple pixels.

I'll now revise the code to implement this additional step.

The outputs consist of a larger grid (6x6) compared to the inputs (3x3), and the expanded grids have several patterned properties.

Let's analyze each of the examples to understand the transformation:

### Example 1:

1. The original cells are split and duplicated in a specific mirrored manner along rows and columns.
2. The left and top rows include cells primarily from the original grid's left and top boundary.
3. The transformation involves mirroring both horizontally and vertically.

### Example 2:

- The similar mirroring pattern continues horizontally and vertically.

### Example 3:

- The same arrangement and expansion pattern are observed.

### Reasoning:

1. **Identify cells along the rows and columns.**
2. **Create an expanded (6x6) grid mirroring the arrangement:**

   - Top-left area is reflected horizontally (left edge) from the 3x3 grid.
   - Top-right area is mirrored horizontally (right edge) from the 3x3 grid.
   - Bottom-left area is mirrored vertically (bottom edge).
   - Bottom-right area is reflected horizontally and vertically.

Apply the transformation preserving the mirror symmetry along both axes.

### Code to Implement This:
Let's write code that expands 3x3 grid (mirroring top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right areas correctly) to a 6x6 pattern matching observations.

def solve(input_matrix):

    output[0:3, 3:6] = grid[:, ::-1]   # Top-right mirrored horizontally
    output[3:6, 0:3] = grid[::-1, :]   # Bottom-left mirrored vertically
    output[3:6, 3:6] = grid[::-1, ::-1]# Bottom-right mirrored both horizontally and vertically

The outputs look reasonably close, but the top right, bottom left, and bottom right areas are not correct. It seems like rather than mirroring, the correct transformation is actually rotation. In particular, the top left isn't rotated, the top right is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the bottom right is rotated 180 degrees, and the bottom left is rotated 270 degrees.

So, the correct transformation rule is:

- Top left: No change
- Top right: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
- Bottom right: Rotate 180 degrees clockwise

I'll examine the difference for each output, analyze what the issue might be, and then propose a fix.

Example 1:

- Based on the color differences section, there are some grey cells whether should be purple cells and vice versa.
- In what quadrant(s) are there issues? There are errors at F2 A5 E1 B6. F2 is in the second row and the sixth column, which is in the top-right quadrant. A5 is in the 5th row and the first column, which is in the bottom-left quadrant. E1 is in the first row and the fifth column, which is in the top-right quadrant. B6 is in the sixth row and the second column, which is in the bottom-left quadrant. It looks like there are issues in the top-right and bottom-left quadrants.
- It seems like the operation being performed to get the cells for the top-right and bottom-left quadrants is incorrect.

Example 2:

- Based on the color differences section, there are issues with many colors of cells.
- In what quadrants are these cells? There is an error at E3 which is in the third row and the fifth column, which is in the top-right quadrant. There is an error at B4 which is in the fourth row and the second column, which is in the bottom-left quadrant. There is an error at F3 which is in the third row and the sixth column, which is in the top-right quadrant. Are any problematic cells that aren't in the top-right or bottom-left quadrants? (That is, in the top-left or bottom-right quadrants.) If a cell were to be located with column A, B, or C and row 1, 2, 3, it would be in the top-left quadrant. Are any of the errors in one of these positions? No. If a cell were to be located with column D, E, or F and row 4, 5, 6, it would be in the bottom-right quadrant. Are any of the errors in one of these positions? No.
- It seems like operation for the top-right and bottom-left quadrants is incorrect.

What is the correct transformation for the top-right and bottom-left quadrants? It look like the top-right quadrant is rotated rather than just mirrored. The bottom-left quadrant is also rotated rather than just mirrored. What orientation does the top-right quadrant need to be in? It seems that the top-right quadrant needs to be rotated 90 degrees clockwise. What orientation does the bottom-left quadrant need to be in? It seems like this is rotated in the opposite direction of the top-right quadrant, so it should be rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.

So, the correct transformation rule is:

- Top left: No change
- Top right: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
- Bottom right: Mirror both horizontally and vertically
- Bottom left: Rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise

I'll use np.rot90 to implement rotations.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the change from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples. I'll also describe the input for each example as seems relevant.

In example 1, a teal (color 8) 2x2 square is removed from around the bottom left. The output contains a teal 2x2 square in a different position, so it appears as though the square has been moved. It was moved to the top left. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey (color 5) outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the teal 2x2 square used to be black (color 0) in the original input. The teal 2x2 square exactly matches the black 2x2 square that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. A fuchsia (color 6) 1x2 rectangle was removed from the top right. The output contains a fuchsia 1x2 rectangle in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the bottom right. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the fuchsia 1x2 rectangle used to be black in the original input. The fuchsia 1x2 rectangle exactly matches the black 1x2 rectangle that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. The rest of the cells in the input are unchanged, including a number of orange (color 7) cells.

In example 2, a green (color 3) L shape is removed from the middle left. The output contains a green L in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the top left. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the green L used to be black in the original input. The green L exactly matches the black L that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. A brown (color 9) rectangle was removed from the top right. The output contains a brown rectangle in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the bottom right. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the brown rectangle used to be black in the original input. The brown rectangle exactly matches the black rectangle that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. The rest of the cells in the input are unchanged, including a number of fuchsia cells.

In example 3, a purple (color 2) shape is removed from the top left. The output contains the same purple shape in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the bottom left. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the purple shape used to be black in the original input. The purple shape exactly matches the black shape that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. A teal (color 8) shape was removed from the bottom right. The output contains a teal shape in a different position, so it seems to have been moved. It was moved to the top right. It seems to have been moved inside of a grey outline that was present in the original input. The new position of the teal shape used to be black in the original input. The teal shape exactly matches the black shape that was in the grey outline in the original input. So, there are no longer any black cells in the grey outline. The rest of the cells in the input are unchanged, including a number of yellow (color 4) cells.

The transformation rule appears to be to take whichever shapes can be used to fill in the gaps in the grey outlines and then move those shapes into the grey outlines. The colored shapes are removed from the old locations (replaced with black) and then the gap is filled in with the corresponding color. This is done while leaving everything else as is.

I should check this proposed rule and make sure it is unambiguous. Are there ever any cases where a different shape could have fit inside the grey outline? I should check example by example.

In example 1, are there any 2x2 squares other than the teal square? No. Are there any 1x2 rectangles other than the fuchsia rectangle? Yes, there is an orange 1x2 rectangle. So, the proposed rule is ambiguous in this case.

So, the rule can't just be to take any shape which fits in the grey outline and move it into the grey outline. I should analyze what's going on with the cells which aren't moved. The cells which aren't moved in example 1 are orange. There are multiple discontiguous orange cells while the teal and fuchsia shapes are unique and contiguous. So, the rule could be to move the contiguous shapes which have a unique color into the outline where they fit. I need to check this rule in the other examples. In example 2, the green and brown shapes are unique and contiguous while the fuchsia cells have multiple discontiguous groups. In example 3, the purple and teal shapes are unique and contiguous while the yellow cells are not. In the additional input, there is a unique orange shape and a unique yellow shape while there are multiple discontiguous groups of purple cells. There are exactly two gaps in the grey outlines. So, this rule is unambiguous here as well.

Ok, I now understand the rule. I need to identify the contiguous shapes which have a unique color and then move them into the corresponding void grey outline.

To implement this, I will:

1. Identify each grey outline. I can do this by finding all of the grey cells and then finding the contiguous grey groupings (which should correspond to each outline). This assumes that each grey outline is disjoint from the others. Is this assumption correct? Yes, it is correct. The grey outlines are disjoint from each other.
2. For each grey outline, I will find the black cells inside of it. Each grey outline is always rectangular, so I can find the bounding box of the grey outline and then find the black cells inside of the bounding box.
3. For each black shape inside of a grey outline, I will find the contiguous shape of the same shape but of a different color. I can do this by finding all of the cells of each color and then finding the contiguous shapes of each color. I will then check if each shape is the same shape as the black shape. I also need to check that the colored shape is the unique contiguous shape of that color.
4. I will then move the colored shape into the grey outline and replace the old location of the colored shape with black.
5. I will then return the new grid.

I will now implement this in code.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the change from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples. I'll also describe the input for each example as seems relevant.

Example 1:

- There is a black background.
- Which cells are grey is the same in the input and output.
- Which cells are orange is the same in the input and output.
- There is a pink shape with the exact shape normalized representation in the input and output, so this shape is just moved without alteration. The pink shape is moved from H3 I3 to H9 I9. H9 I9 was previously a black shape with exactly the same shape as the pink shape.
- In the output, the black H9 I9 shape is removed. (It is replaced with pink)
- The original pink cells, H3 I3 are changed to black in the output.
- There is a purple shape with a matching normalized representation in the input and output as well. The purple shape is moved from B9 C9 B10 C10 to C3 D3 C4 D4. C3 D3 C4 D4 was previously a black shape with exactly the same shape as the purple shape.
- The black C3 D3 C4 D4 shape is removed. (It is replaced with purple)
- The original purple cells, B9 C9 B10 C10 are changed to black in the output.
- The grey shapes each have a hole in them. These holes are black. These holes were replaced with the pink and purple shapes.

Example 2:

- There is a black background.
- Which cells are grey is the same in the input and output.
- Which cells are pink is the same in the input and output.
- There is a green shape with the exact shape normalized representation in the input and output, so this shape is just moved without alteration. The green shape is moved from A6 B6 C6 C7 to B2 C2 D2 D3. B2 C2 D2 D3 was previously a black shape with exactly the same shape as the green shape.
- In the output, the black B2 C2 D2 D3 shape is removed. (It is replaced with green)
- The original green cells, A6 B6 C6 C7 are changed to black in the output.
- There is a brown shape with the exact shape normalized representation in the input and output, so this shape is just moved without alteration. The brown shape is moved from A1 B1 C1 [skip] to E8 F8 G8 [skip]. ([skip] denotes we skipped some of the shape for brevity.) E8 F8 G8 [skip] was previously a black shape with exactly the same shape as the brown shape.
- In the output, the black E8 F8 G8 [skip] shape is removed. (It is replaced with brown)
- The original brown cells, A1 B1 C1 [skip], are changed to black in the output.
- The grey shapes each have a hole in them. These holes are black. These holes were replaced with the green and brown shapes.


It seems like the rule is to take the shapes which can fill the black holes in the grey shapes and move them into the corresponding position of the old black shape. (Replacing this colored shape's old position with black.) The grey shapes which have these holes (grey outlines) and other colors are unchanged. I should check that this rule is unambiguous so far. Is there always only one shape which can be moved into each void in the grey outlines? I can use the normalized shape representation to check if shapes are equivalent (up to translation and color). In example 1, the normalized representation of the first black hole is A1 A2 B1 B2. Does any shape other than the purple shape match this in the input? No. The normalized representation of the second black hold is A1 B1. Does any shape other than the pink shape match this in the input? Yes, there is a matching orange shape.

So, the rule must be something slightly different. What shapes get moved? The shapes which fit in the hole get moved, but this doesn't exclude the matching orange shape. What shapes don't get moved? The grey is never moved and black is used for the background. None of the orange color cells get moved in Example 1 and none of the pink color cells get moved in Example 2. These colors each have multiple disconnected shapes. So, the rule could be to move the shapes where the corresponding color has only one connected component. Also, where the color isn't grey or black.

I'll now review Example 3 and check that this rule matches.

Example 3:

- Are there non-grey and non-black colors which just have one connected component? Yes, the purple and red colors each have one connected component.
- Are these shapes moved? There appears to be a shape with identical normalized representation in the output but different position. So the answer is yes, they are moved.
- Are they moved into a black hole? Were there black holes at the new positions of the purple and red shapes? Yes.
- So this seems to match the rule.
- Is anything else moved or changed other than the black holes and purple and red? No. So this matches the rule.

Ok, I now understand the rule. I need to identify the non-grey and non-black colors which have only one connected component and then move this connected component into the hole in the grey outline which has a matching shape.

To implement this, I will:

1. Identify the non-grey and non-black colors which only have a single connected component. Get the location and shape of this connected component. We expect two such connected components.
2. Identify each grey outline. I can do this by finding all of the grey cells and then finding the contiguous grey groupings (which should correspond to each outline). This assumes that each grey outline is disjoint from the others. Is this assumption correct? Yes, it is correct. The grey outlines are disjoint from each other.
3. For each grey outline, I will find the black cells inside of it. Each grey outline is always rectangular, so I can find the bounding box of the grey outline and then find the black cells inside of the bounding box.
4. For each black shape inside of a grey outline, I will determine which of the two shapes we identified in step 1 matches the black shape. I will then move the matching shape into the grey outline and replace the old location of the colored shape with black.

I will now implement this in code.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the change from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples. I'll also describe the input for each example as seems relevant.

In example 1, the purple (color 8) shape is reflected across the vertical line at the left edge of the purple shape. There is also a yellow (color 4) shape below the purple shape which is unchanged.

In example 2, the purple shape is reflected across the vertical line at the right edge of the purple shape. The purple shape is different from the purple shape in example 1. There is also a yellow shape below the purple shape which is unchanged. The yellow shape is different from the yellow shape in example 1. Based on the normalized shape representation, it isn't just shifted, it has a different shape. (Though the shape is qualitatively similar to example 1.)

In example 3, the purple shape is reflected across the vertical line at the left edge of the purple shape. The purple shape is different from the purple shape in example 1. There is also a yellow shape below the purple shape which is unchanged. The yellow shape is the same as the yellow shape in example 1.

In the additional input, there is a purple shape and there is also a yellow shape. The purple shape is different from the purple shape in example 1. The yellow shape is the same as the yellow shape in example 2 (which isn't the same as example 1).

The rule is to reflect the purple shape across a vertical line at the edge of the purple shape. I need to determine which side of the purple shape to reflect towards. Example 2 differs from examples 1 and 3 in which side the purple shape is reflected towards. Are there any salient commonalities between examples 1 and 3 which differ from example 2? Yes, the yellow shape is the same in examples 1 and 3. The yellow shape is different in example 2. So, which of the two possible yellow shapes is present determines which side the purple shape is reflected towards.

If the normalized yellow shape matches A1 A2 B2 C2 B3 then the purple shape is reflected towards the left. If the yellow shape matches C1 A2 B2 C2 B3 then the purple shape is reflected towards the right.

I can implement the rule by first checking which of the two yellow shapes we see based on the normalized version of the shape. Then, I just need to reflect the purple shape based on which yellow shape we see. If it is A1 A2 B2 C2 B3 I reflect towards the left. If it is C1 A2 B2 C2 B3 I reflect towards the right.

In my implementation, I'll use tuples of indices (which are zero indexed) instead of letter number pairs (where the number is one-indexed). So, I should go ahead and make sure I know the converted values for using as a constant in the code. A1 A2 B2 C2 B3 becomes [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)] (reflect toward the left). C1 A2 B2 C2 B3 becomes [(0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)] (reflect toward the right). I'll need to standardize the order of shapes represented as lists of tuples. I'll sort to standardize the order.

I will now implement this in code.

I'll describe the change from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples. I'll also describe the input for each example as seems relevant.

In example 1, the two purple (color 8) cells (C4| J4) are connected by a green (color 3) line. The line is horizontal and connects the two purple cells. I'll double-check that it actually connects these cells. The purple cells are at C4 and J4. So, if the horizontal green line were to connect, it would go from D4 to I4. Is this the case? I can look at the location by color representation under output 1. It does go from D4 to I4 and connects the cells.

In example 2, the four purple cells are connected by green lines. The lines are vertical and connect the purple cells in pairs. I'll check that the vertical green lines actually connect the purple cells. There are purple cells at E2| I3| I7| E8. So, my understanding indicates there should be a line from E3 to E7 and from I4 to I6. I'll check under the location by color representation. Yes, the shapes are connected as expected. I'll stop checking this step-by-step for the rest of the examples, but I should stay alert and notice deviations from what seems to be the pattern.

In example 3, the four purple cells are connected by green lines. The lines are horizontal and connect the purple cells in pairs.

In example 4, the two purple cells are connected by a green line. The line is vertical and connects the two purple cells.

In example 5, there is only one purple cell, so no green line is added.

In example 6, the two purple cells are not connected by a green line. This is because the purple cells are not aligned horizontally or vertically.

In example 7, the three purple cells are connected by a green line. The line is vertical and connects the purple cells in pairs.

In example 8, the five purple cells are connected by green lines. The lines are vertical and horizontal and connect the purple cells in pairs.

The rule is to connect the purple cells with green lines if they are aligned horizontally or vertically. If they are not aligned, no green line is added.

To implement this, I will:

1. Identify the purple cells.
2. Check which pairs of purple cells are aligned horizontally or vertically.
3. For each pair of purple cells that are aligned horizontally or vertically, add a green line connecting them. The green line should fill in the cells in between the purple cells (but should not overwrite the purple cells).
4. Return the new grid.

I will now implement this in code.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples to infer the transformation rule. I'll also describe the input for each example.

In example 1:

- There is a black background.
- A new yellow (color 4) cell is added at F7. In the input, F7 was a purple cell. The input had a yellow cell at F10 and this is retained in the output.
- A new pink (color 6) cell is added at E7. In the input, E7 was a purple cell. The input had a pink cell at A7 and this is retained in the output.
- The purple (color 8) shape has lost the cells: E4 E7 F7. In the input, it was a rectangle, but it is now a rectangle with some cells removed. The removed cells are on the edge.
- A new brown (color 9) cell is added at E4. In the input, E4 was a purple cell. The input had a brown cell at E1 and this is retained in the output.
- The newly added cells match the previously existing cell of the same color in either column or row and were previously on the edge of the purple rectangle.

In example 2:

- There is a black background.
- A new blue (color 1) cell is added at F8. In the input, F8 was a purple cell. The input had a blue cell at F10 and this is retained in the output.
- A new red (color 2) cell is added at F6. In the input, F6 was a purple cell. The input had a red cell at J6 and this is retained in the output.
- A new green (color 3) cell is added at D8. In the input, D8 was a purple cell. The input had a green cell at A8 and this is retained in the output.
- A new pink (color 6) cell is added at D4. In the input, D4 was a purple cell. The input had a pink cell at A4 and this is retained in the output.
- A new orange (color 7) cell is added at E4. In the input, E4 was a purple cell. The input had an orange cell at E1 and this is retained in the output.
- The purple shape has lost the cells: D4 E4 F6 D8 F8. It was a rectangle in the input and the removed cells are on the edge.
- The newly added cells match the previously existing cell of the same color in either column or row and were previously on the edge of the purple rectangle.

In example 3:

- There is a black background.
- New red cells are added at D7 and F8. In the input, D7 and F8 were purple cells. The input had red cells at A7 and J8 and these are retained in the output.
- A new green cell is added at D5. In the input, D5 was a purple cell. The input had a green cell at A5 and this is retained in the output.
- A new yellow cell is added at D4. In the input, D4 was a purple cell. The input had a yellow cell at D1 and this is retained in the output.
- A new pink cell is added at F4. In the input, F4 was a purple cell. The input had a pink cell at J4 and this is retained in the output.
- A new orange cell is added at D8. In the input, D8 was a purple cell. The input had an orange cell at D10 and this is retained in the output.
- The purple shape has lost the cells: D4 F4 D5 D7 D8 F8. It was a rectangle in the input and the removed cells are on the edge.
- The newly added cells match some previously existing cell of the same color in either column or row and were previously on the edge of the purple rectangle.

For each existing non-purple and non-black cell, a new cell of the same color is added in the same row or column. The position of this new cell is always on an edge of the purple rectangle. Does the combination of being in the same row/column and being on the edge of the purple cell unambiguously constrain the position of the new cell? No, there are two edges of the purple shape in any given line. Also, if the line exactly lines up with an edge, all of these edge cells are in the corresponding row/column. So, this is not unambiguous and I need to look for an additional constraint on the position of the new cell. Going back to example 1, I'll examine the yellow cell which was originally in F10. This cell is in a column which overlaps with an edge of the purple shape that includes F4 F5 F6 F7. The cell was actually added in F7 which is the bottom most of these and the closest to F10 (the original yellow cell). I'll check some more cells to determine the rule.

Checking more cells:

- In example 1, the pink cell was originally in A7. This cell is in a row which overlaps with E7 and F7 from the purple shape. E7 was replaced which is the left most and the closest to A7 (the original pink cell).
- In example 1, the brown cell was originally in E1. This cell is in a column which overlaps with E4 E5 E6 E7 from the purple shape. E4 was replaced which is the top most and the closest to E1 (the original brown cell). So, it seems like bottom most can't be part of the rule, but closest to the original cell is possible. I'll check some cells from example 2 which are on the right side unlike the pink cell to narrow down the rule.
- In example 2, the right side is J. The red cell was originally in J6. This cell is in a row which overlaps with D6 E6 F6 from the purple shape. F6 was replaced which is the right most and the closest to J6 (the original red cell). So, it seems like closest to the original cell is the rule.

Does it seem like the addition is always closest to the original cell? Yes, it does.

I can now infer the transformation rule.

1. Identify a purple rectangle in the center.
2. Look for non-black and non-purple cells.
3. For each such colored cell found, replace a single cell on the edge of the central shape.
4. The cell to replace is the one which is closest to the original cell in the same column/row.
5. If the colored cell is above/below the central shape, the closest cell will be the cell in the top/bottom (respectively) of the purple shape in the same column as the original colored cell.
6. If the colored cell is to the left/right of the central shape, the closest cell will be the cell on the left/right (respectively) of the purple shape in the same row as the original colored cell.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples to infer the transformation rule. I'll also describe the input for each example.

In example 1:

- There is a black background and the rightmost 3 columns are all red.
- In the input, there are 2 purple cells (D11| C12).
- In the output, green cells are added.
- The purple cells and the red cells remain unchanged.
- The green cells form two diagonal lines at different angles.
- The green cells are all disconnected, the diagonal line consists of cells which are adjacent over the diagonal but not otherwise.
- D10 is a green cell which is nearby the purple cells. E10 is diagonally adjacent to D11 (D11 is one row lower and one column to the left). The other purple cell, C12 is also diagonally adjacent in the same way where it is one row lower and one column to the left.
- There is a diagonal line extending out from E10. It goes from E10 to F9 which is one row higher and one column to the right. The line seems to continue with F9 G8 H7 I6 J5. However, the next green cell is I4 which breaks the pattern: it is one row higher, but it is one column to the left instead of to the right.
- After I4 there is H3 G2 F1 which continues the pattern of one row higher and one column to the left.
- So, there is a diagonal line which starts at a cell diagonally adjacent to the purple cells and then goes one row higher and one column to the right for the next cell. The pattern is broken at I4 which switches the direction of the diagonal line.
- We can think of the purple cells as being in the same diagonal as we have C12 D11 E10 F9 and so on which starts with the purple cells and continues the pattern.
- Can we determine the reason why the diagonal line changes direction at this point? It changes at J5. J5 is directly to the left of the red cell at K5. K is the leftmost column of the red wall. The next cell after J5 if the trend had continued would have been K4 which is directly above the red cell at K5 and is also a red cell. So, the change in direction is at the red cell.

In example 2:

- There is a black background and the bottommost 3 columns are all red.
- In the input, there are 3 purple cells (A3| B4| C5). These purple cells form a diagonal.
- In the output, green cells are added while everything else remains the same.
- The green cells seem to form diagonals again.
- There is a green cell by the purple cells. D6 is diagonally adjacent to C5. D6 also continues the pattern of A3 B4 C5 (the purple cells).
- Does the pattern continue after D6? Yes, there is E7 F8 G9. However, the pattern breaks there. The next cell in the pattern would have been H10 which is a red cell. However, there is I7 which is still one column to the right, but it is one row higher instead of one row lower. After I7 the pattern continues with J6 K5 L4.
- Again, the diagonal line changes direction when it otherwise would have intersected with a red cell.

It seems like the rule involves drawing out diagonals from the purple cells. The diagonal continues in the diagonal line formed by the purple cells until it would intersect with a red cell. At this point, the diagonal line changes direction to avoid the red cell. The diagonal line seems to reflect off of the red cell/wall.

So, the rule could be:

- Draw a diagonal line of green cells continuing the purple diagonal. There are two possible directions in which the green diagonal could go (continuing either side of the purple diagonal). So, I need to determine what the rule is for which direction is used. In examples 1 and 2, one of the purple cells is on the edge of the grid and thus the diagonal line wouldn't be visible in that direction. So, the diagonal line should continue the direction which isn't off the grid.
- If the diagonal line would intersect with a red cell, change the direction of the diagonal line to avoid the red cell. The diagonal line should reflect off of the red cell/wall. In example 1, the reflection is off of a vertical wall on the right side of the grid while in example 2, the reflection is off of a horizontal wall occupying the bottom of the grid. So, both vertical and horizontal reflections are possible.
- The diagonal line continues until it leaves the grid.

I'll quickly check this on example 3 to confirm the rule.

In example 3:

- There are purple cells at G10| H11| I12. So, J13 would be off the grid, so the diagonal line should be formed in the other direction starting at F9. Is there a green cell at F9 in the output? Yes. Does the diagonal continue after I12 H11 G10 F9? Yes, it continues with F9 E8 D7 C6. At that point it deviates with D5.
- Is the deviation at D5 due to reflecting off of a red cell? The diagonal would have continued to B5. Is this a red cell? Yes. So the deviation does seem to be due to a reflection.

This confirms the rule.

Mechanically, how would this rule be implemented? Here are the steps:

1. First, identify the purple cells.
2. Next, identify the two possible directions in which the purple diagonal line could continue. We can compute the difference between purple cells to find the diagonal angle.
3. Determine which of these directions doesn't result in the first cell of the diagonal immediately going off the grid. We can compute the next diagonal cell in either direction and then check if this cell is within the grid.
4. Trace out the corresponding diagonal line until the next cell would intersect with a red cell. When the next cell would intersect, reflect the diagonal line off of the red wall. To do this, we need to know the orientation of the red wall. We can see if what adjacent red cells are next to the red cell we were about to intersect with. This will define the orientation of the red wall. If the red wall is vertical, we need to flip the column direction of the diagonal line. If the red wall is horizontal, we need to flip the row direction of the diagonal line.
5. Continue the diagonal line until it leaves the grid.

I will now implement this in code.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the change from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples. I'll also describe the input for each example as seems relevant.

In example 1, additional purple (color 8) cells are added near the other purple cells. It appears like the purple shape is reflected across the vertical line at the left edge of the purple shape. There is also a yellow (color 4) shape below the purple shape which is unchanged.

In example 2, additional purple cells are added near the original purple cells. It appears like the purple shape is reflected across the vertical line at the right edge of the purple shape. The purple shape is different from the purple shape in example 1. There is also a yellow shape below the purple shape which is unchanged. The yellow shape is different from the yellow shape in example 1. Based on the normalized shape representation, it isn't just shifted, it has a different shape. (Though the shape is qualitatively similar to example 1.)

In example 3, purple cells are added near the other purple cells and it appears like the purple shape is reflected across the vertical line at the left edge of the purple shape. The purple shape is different from the purple shape in example 1. There is also a yellow shape below the purple shape which is unchanged. The yellow shape is the same as the yellow shape in example 1.

In the additional input, there is a purple shape and there is also a yellow shape. The purple shape is different from the purple shape in example 1. The yellow shape is the same as the yellow shape in example 2 (which isn't the same as example 1).

The rule is to reflect the purple shape across a vertical line at the edge of the purple shape. I need to determine which side of the purple shape to reflect towards. Example 2 differs from examples 1 and 3 in which side the purple shape is reflected towards. Are there any salient commonalities between examples 1 and 3 which differ from example 2? Yes, the yellow shape is the same in examples 1 and 3. The yellow shape is different in example 2. So, which of the two possible yellow shapes is present determines which side the purple shape is reflected towards.

If the normalized yellow shape matches A1 A2 B2 C2 B3 then the purple shape is reflected towards the left. If the yellow shape matches C1 A2 B2 C2 B3 then the purple shape is reflected towards the right.

I can implement the rule by first checking which of the two yellow shapes we see based on the normalized version of the shape. Then, I just need to reflect the purple shape based on which yellow shape we see. If it is A1 A2 B2 C2 B3 I reflect towards the left. If it is C1 A2 B2 C2 B3 I reflect towards the right.

In my implementation, I'll use tuples of indices (which are zero indexed) instead of letter number pairs (where the number is one-indexed). So, I should go ahead and make sure I know the converted values for using as a constant in the code. A1 A2 B2 C2 B3 becomes [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)] (reflect toward the left). C1 A2 B2 C2 B3 becomes [(0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)] (reflect toward the right). I'll need to standardize the order of shapes represented as lists of tuples. I'll sort to standardize the order.

I will now implement this in code.

I'll describe the change from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples. I'll also describe the input for each example as seems relevant.

Example 1:

- There is a black background.
- There are a small number of changes: some black cells change to pink, some pink cells change to black, some black cells change to purple, and some purple cells change to black. No other colors are changed.
- There is a pink shape with the exact shape normalized representation in the input and output, so this shape is just moved without alteration. The pink shape is moved from H3 I3 to H9 I9. H9 I9 was previously a black shape with exactly the same shape as the pink shape.
- In the output, the black H9 I9 shape is removed. (It is replaced with pink)
- The original pink cells, H3 I3 are changed to black in the output.
- There is a purple shape with a matching normalized representation in the input and output as well. The purple shape is moved from B9 C9 B10 C10 to C3 D3 C4 D4. C3 D3 C4 D4 was previously a black shape with exactly the same shape as the purple shape.
- The black C3 D3 C4 D4 shape is removed. (It is replaced with purple)
- The original purple cells, B9 C9 B10 C10 are changed to black in the output.
- The grey shapes each have a hole in them. These holes are black. These holes were replaced with the pink and purple shapes.

Example 2:

- There is a black background.
- Some black cells change to green, some green cells change to black, some black cells change to brown, and some brown cells change to black. No other colors are changed.
- There is a green shape with the exact shape normalized representation in the input and output, so this shape is just moved without alteration. The green shape is moved from A6 B6 C6 C7 to B2 C2 D2 D3. B2 C2 D2 D3 was previously a black shape with exactly the same shape as the green shape.
- In the output, the black B2 C2 D2 D3 shape is removed. (It is replaced with green)
- The original green cells, A6 B6 C6 C7 are changed to black in the output.
- There is a brown shape with the exact shape normalized representation in the input and output, so this shape is just moved without alteration. The brown shape is moved from A1 B1 C1 [skip] to E8 F8 G8 [skip]. ([skip] denotes we skipped some of the shape for brevity.) E8 F8 G8 [skip] was previously a black shape with exactly the same shape as the brown shape.
- In the output, the black E8 F8 G8 [skip] shape is removed. (It is replaced with brown)
- The original brown cells, A1 B1 C1 [skip], are changed to black in the output.
- The grey shapes each have a hole in them. These holes are black. These holes were replaced with the green and brown shapes.

It seems like the rule is to take the shapes which can fill the black holes in the grey shapes and move them into the corresponding position of the old black shape. (Replacing this colored shape's old position with black.) The grey shapes which have these holes (grey outlines) and other colors are unchanged. I should check that this rule is unambiguous so far. Is there always only one shape which can be moved into each void in the grey outlines? I can use the normalized shape representation to check if shapes are equivalent (up to translation and color). In example 1, the normalized representation of the first black hole is A1 A2 B1 B2. Does any shape other than the purple shape match this in the input? No. The normalized representation of the second black hold is A1 B1. Does any shape other than the pink shape match this in the input? Yes, there is a matching orange shape.

So, the rule must be something slightly different. What shapes get moved? The shapes which fit in the hole get moved, but this doesn't exclude the matching orange shape. What shapes don't get moved? The grey is never moved and black is used for the background. None of the orange color cells get moved in Example 1 and none of the pink color cells get moved in Example 2. These colors each have multiple disconnected shapes. So, the rule could be to move the shapes where the corresponding color has only one connected component. Also, where the color isn't grey or black.

I'll now review Example 3 and check that this rule matches.

Example 3:

- Are there non-grey and non-black colors which just have one connected component? Yes, the purple and red colors each have one connected component.
- Are these shapes moved? There appears to be a shape with identical normalized representation in the output but different position. So the answer is yes, they are moved.
- Are they moved into a black hole? Were there black holes at the new positions of the purple and red shapes? Yes.
- So this seems to match the rule.
- Is anything else moved or changed other than the black holes and purple and red? No. So this matches the rule.

Ok, I now understand the rule. I need to identify the non-grey and non-black colors which have only one connected component and then move this connected component into the hole in the grey outline which has a matching shape.

To implement this, I will:

1. Identify the non-grey and non-black colors which only have a single connected component. Get the location and shape of this connected component. We expect two such connected components.
2. Identify each grey outline. I can do this by finding all of the grey cells and then finding the contiguous grey groupings (which should correspond to each outline). This assumes that each grey outline is disjoint from the others. Is this assumption correct? Yes, it is correct. The grey outlines are disjoint from each other.
3. For each grey outline, I will find the black cells inside of it. Each grey outline is always rectangular, so I can find the bounding box of the grey outline and then find the black cells inside of the bounding box.
4. For each black shape inside of a grey outline, I will determine which of the two shapes we identified in step 1 matches the black shape. I will then move the matching shape into the grey outline and replace the old location of the colored shape with black.

I will now implement this in code.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples to infer the transformation rule. I'll also describe the input for each example.

In example 1:

- There is a black background.
- Purple (color 8) changes to yellow (color 4) at F7, which is a single cell swap.
- A purple cell is changed to pink (color 6) at E7.
- A purple cell is changed to brown (color 9) at E4.
- No other changes are made.
- The input has a single yellow cell, a single pink cell, and a single brown cell. These cells are retained in the output.
- The input has a purple rectangle.
- Some of the cells of this purple rectangle are replaced by other colors: F7 E7 E4 (as noted earlier). The replaced cells are on the edge of the purple rectangle. After this change, the purple shape has the shape of a rectangle with some cells removed from the edge.
- The replaced cells have the same column or row as one of the individual colored cells in the input. The corresponding individual colored cell (in the same column or row) has the same color as the replaced cell.

In example 2:

- There is a black background.
- A purple cell is changed to blue (color 1) at F8.
- A purple cell is changed to red (color 2) at F6.
- A purple cell is changed to green (color 3) at D8.
- A purple cell is changed to pink at D4.
- A purple cell is changed to orange (color 7) at E4.
- No other changes are made.
- The input has a single blue cell, a single red cell, and a single green cell. These cells are retained in the output.
- The input has a purple rectangle.
- Some of the cells of this purple rectangle are replaced by other colors: F8 F6 D8 D4 E4 (as noted earlier). The replaced cells are on the edge of the purple rectangle. After this change, the purple shape has the shape of a rectangle with some cells removed from the edge.
- The replaced cells have the same column or row as one of the individual colored cells in the input. The corresponding individual colored cell (in the same column or row) has the same color as the replaced cell.

In example 3:

- There is a black background.
- Some purple cells are changed to red at D7 F8.
- A purple cell is changed to green at D5.
- A purple cell is changed to yellow at D4.
- A purple cell is changed to pink at F4.
- A purple cell is changed to orange at D8.
- No other changes are made.
- The input has a two red cells, a single green cell, a single yellow cell, a single pink cell, and a single orange cell. These cells are retained in the output.
- The purple shape has lost the cells: D7 F8 D5 D4 F4 D8 (as noted earlier). The removed cells are on the edge of the purple rectangle. After this change, the purple shape has the shape of a rectangle with some cells removed from the edge.
- The removed cells have the same column or row as one of the individual colored cells in the input. The corresponding individual colored cell (in the same column or row) has the same color as the removed cell. The added red cells each correspond to one of the existing red cells in the input.

For each existing non-purple and non-black cell, a new cell of the same color is added in the same row or column. The position of this new cell is always on an edge of the purple rectangle. Does the combination of being in the same row/column and being on the edge of the purple cell unambiguously constrain the position of the new cell? No, there are two edges of the purple shape in any given line. Also, if the line exactly lines up with an edge, all of these edge cells are in the corresponding row/column. So, this is not unambiguous and I need to look for an additional constraint on the position of the new cell. Going back to example 1, I'll examine the yellow cell which was originally in F10. This cell is in a column which overlaps with an edge of the purple shape that includes F4 F5 F6 F7. The cell was actually added in F7 which is the bottom most of these and the closest to F10 (the original yellow cell). I'll check some more cells to determine the rule.

Checking more cells:

- In example 1, the pink cell was originally in A7. This cell is in a row which overlaps with E7 and F7 from the purple shape. E7 was replaced which is the left most and the closest to A7 (the original pink cell).
- In example 1, the brown cell was originally in E1. This cell is in a column which overlaps with E4 E5 E6 E7 from the purple shape. E4 was replaced which is the top most and the closest to E1 (the original brown cell). So, it seems like bottom most can't be part of the rule, but closest to the original cell is possible. I'll check some cells from example 2 which are on the right side unlike the pink cell to narrow down the rule.
- In example 2, the right side is J. The red cell was originally in J6. This cell is in a row which overlaps with D6 E6 F6 from the purple shape. F6 was replaced which is the right most and the closest to J6 (the original red cell). So, it seems like closest to the original cell is the rule.

Does it seem like the addition is always closest to the original cell? Yes, it does.

I can now infer the transformation rule.

1. Identify a purple rectangle in the center.
2. Look for non-black and non-purple cells.
3. For each such colored cell found, replace a single cell on the edge of the central shape.
4. The cell to replace is the one which is closest to the original cell in the same column/row.
5. If the colored cell is above/below the central shape, the closest cell will be the cell in the top/bottom (respectively) of the purple shape in the same column as the original colored cell.
6. If the colored cell is to the left/right of the central shape, the closest cell will be the cell on the left/right (respectively) of the purple shape in the same row as the original colored cell.

Now let's implement this in the code.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples to infer the transformation rule. I'll also describe the input for each example.

In example 1:

- There is a black background and the rightmost 3 columns are all red.
- In the input, there are 2 purple cells (D11 C12).
- In the output, green cells are added. (Replacing the black background and replacing no other colors.)
- No other changes are made.
- The green cells form two diagonal lines at different angles.
- These diagonal lines consists of cells which are adjacent over the diagonal. The lines are one cell wide.
- D10 is a green cell which is nearby the purple cells. E10 is diagonally adjacent to D11 (D11 is one row lower and one column to the left). The other purple cell, C12 is also diagonally adjacent in the same way where it is one row lower and one column to the left.
- There is a diagonal line extending out from E10. It goes from E10 to F9 which is one row higher and one column to the right. The line seems to continue with F9 G8 H7 I6 J5. However, the next green cell is I4 which breaks the pattern: it is one row higher, but it is one column to the left instead of to the right.
- After I4 there is H3 G2 F1 which continues the pattern of one row higher and one column to the left.
- So, there is a diagonal line which starts at a cell diagonally adjacent to the purple cells and then goes one row higher and one column to the right for the next cell. The pattern is broken at I4 which switches the direction of the diagonal line.
- We can think of the purple cells as being in the same diagonal as we have C12 D11 E10 F9 and so on which starts with the purple cells and continues the pattern.
- Can we determine the reason why the diagonal line changes direction at this point? It changes at J5. J5 is directly to the left of the red cell at K5. K is the leftmost column of the red wall. The next cell after J5 if the trend had continued would have been K4 which is directly above the red cell at K5 and is also a red cell. So, the change in direction is at the red cell.

In example 2:

- There is a black background and the bottommost 3 columns are all red.
- In the input, there are 3 purple cells (A3 B4 C5). These purple cells form a diagonal.
- In the output, green cells are added while everything else remains the same.
- The green cells seem to form diagonals again.
- There is a green cell by the purple cells. D6 is diagonally adjacent to C5. D6 also continues the pattern of A3 B4 C5 (the purple cells).
- Does the pattern continue after D6? Yes, there is E7 F8 G9. However, the pattern breaks there. The next cell in the pattern would have been H10 which is a red cell. However, there is I7 which is still one column to the right, but it is one row higher instead of one row lower. After I7 the pattern continues with J6 K5 L4.
- Again, the diagonal line changes direction when it otherwise would have intersected with a red cell.

It seems like the rule involves drawing out diagonals from the purple cells. The diagonal continues in the diagonal line formed by the purple cells until it would intersect with a red cell. At this point, the diagonal line changes direction to avoid the red cell. The diagonal line seems to reflect off of the red cell/wall.

So, the rule could be:

- Draw a diagonal line of green cells continuing the purple diagonal. There are two possible directions in which the green diagonal could go (continuing either side of the purple diagonal). So, I need to determine what the rule is for which direction is used. In examples 1 and 2, one of the purple cells is on the edge of the grid and thus the diagonal line wouldn't be visible in that direction. So, the diagonal line should continue the direction which isn't off the grid.
- If the diagonal line would intersect with a red cell, change the direction of the diagonal line to avoid the red cell. The diagonal line should reflect off of the red cell/wall. In example 1, the reflection is off of a vertical wall on the right side of the grid while in example 2, the reflection is off of a horizontal wall occupying the bottom of the grid. So, both vertical and horizontal reflections are possible.
- The diagonal line continues until it leaves the grid.

I'll quickly check this on example 3 to confirm the rule.

In example 3:

- There are purple cells at G10 H11 I12. So, J13 would be off the grid, so the diagonal line should be formed in the other direction starting at F9. Is there a green cell at F9 in the output? Yes. Does the diagonal continue after I12 H11 G10 F9? Yes, it continues with F9 E8 D7 C6. At that point it deviates with D5.
- Is the deviation at D5 due to reflecting off of a red cell? The diagonal would have continued to B5. Is this a red cell? Yes. So the deviation does seem to be due to a reflection.

This confirms the rule.

Mechanically, how would this rule be implemented? Here are the steps:

1. First, identify the purple cells.
2. Next, identify the two possible directions in which the purple diagonal line could continue. We can compute the difference between purple cells to find the diagonal angle.
3. Determine which of these directions doesn't result in the first cell of the diagonal immediately going off the grid. We can compute the next diagonal cell in either direction and then check if this cell is within the grid.
4. Trace out the corresponding diagonal line until the next cell would intersect with a red cell. When the next cell would intersect, reflect the diagonal line off of the red wall. To do this, we need to know the orientation of the red wall. We can see if what adjacent red cells are next to the red cell we were about to intersect with. This will define the orientation of the red wall. If the red wall is vertical, we need to flip the column direction of the diagonal line. If the red wall is horizontal, we need to flip the row direction of the diagonal line.
5. Continue the diagonal line until it leaves the grid.

I will now implement this in code.

The outputs don't have the same shape as the inputs, and they don't appear to be somewhat edited copies of the input.

The inputs appear to consist of "noisy" segments which are either stacked on top of each other or side-by-side. In other words, they are either noisy columns or noisy rows. Each segment consists of exactly one color. These colors also appear in the output.

In two of the example inputs (inputs 2 and 3), there are horizontal segments (rows) which are stacked on top of each other. The outputs for these inputs are each single columns. The color of each cell in the output column is the color of the corresponding segment in the input.

In the other example input (input 1), there are vertical segments (columns) which are stacked side-by-side. The output for this input is a single row. The color of each cell in the output row is the color of the corresponding segment in the input.

In the additional input, there are vertical segments (columns) which are stacked side-by-side. This input matches the "noisy" segment pattern of the other inputs.

The transformation rule appears to be to identify the colors of the segments and then to stack them side-by-side if they are columns or on top of each other if they are rows.

My code will first need to determine if the input consists of column segments or row segments. Then, it will need to identify the colors of the segments and stack them side-by-side or on top of each other as appropriate.

How can I determine if the input consists of column segments or row segments? Inputs which consist of column segments don't necessarily have the same color in each literal column of the grid as it is "noisy". However, they do always have the same color in the leftmost (or rightmost) column. Otherwise, the leftmost (or rightmost) segment wouldn't be connected. Similarly, inputs which consist of row segments don't necessarily have the same color in each literal row of the grid as it is "noisy". However, they do always have the same color in the topmost (or bottommost) row.

So, to identify if the input consists of column segments or row segments, I can check if all of the cells in the leftmost column have the same color. If they do, then the input consists of column segments. Otherwise, the input consists of row segments.

I need to know the colors of the segments (in order). I know that the segments are connected. So, I can take any row/column which includes all of the segments and then deduplicate the colors in that row/column. The resulting list of colors will be the colors of the segments (in order). If the input consists of column segments, then I want to look at a row/column which will intersect with all of these segments. So, in the case of column segments, I want to look at any row. I'll use the top row. If the input consists of row segments, then I want to look at a row/column which will intersect with all of these segments. So, in the case of row segments, I want to look at any column. I'll use the left column.

I'll use numpy in the code to make it easier to work with the grid.

The code should:

- Identify if the input consists of column segments or row segments. This can be done by checking if all of the cells in the leftmost column have the same color.
- Identify the colors of the segments (in order). This can be done by looking at the top row if the input consists of column segments and by looking at the left column if the input consists of row segments.
- If the input is columns, return a single row where each cell is the color of the corresponding segment. If the input is rows, return a single column where each cell is the color of the corresponding segment.

I'll now write the code.

The output does not have the same shape as the input. In this case, it appears that the output is a subset of the input.

I'll examine each input in detail.

Example 1:

- The output seems to be the subset of the input which extracts the red (color 2) shape in the input. It keeps the blue (color 1) background cells within the red shape.
- The background is blue.
- There is also a green (color 3) shape and a few purple (color 8) shapes in the input. These shapes aren't transferred to the output as they aren't in the corresponding rectangle which is extracted.
- The green shape seems similar in style to a rotated version of the red shape, though it differs.
- Both the red shape and the green shape have bilateral symmetry.
- The purple shapes appear to be the result of cutting off a scaled-up version of the red shape. This cuts it into parts. It is cut off by the bottom edge.

Example 2:

- The output extracts the bounding box around the yellow shape.
- The background is purple.
- There is a green shape and a partially cut-off pink shape in the input. They aren't in the corresponding bounding box, so they aren't transferred to the output.
- The green shape appears to be a rotated version of the yellow shape.
- The pink shape appears to be a scaled-up version of the yellow shape though it is cut off by the bottom corner.

Example 3:

- The output extracts the bounding box around the purple shape.
- The background is red.
- There is a green shape and two blue shapes in the bottom right. They aren't transferred to the output.
- The blue shapes are bars.

Example 4:

- The output extracts the bounding box around the green shape.
- The background is blue
- There is a red shape and a purple shape in the input. They aren't transferred to the output.
- The red shape appears to be a scaled-up version of the green shape but cut off by the left edge.

The transformation rule seems to extract the bounding box around one of the shapes. I need to determine which shape it extracts.

What do I notice about the shape it extracts? The shape is small rather than one of the bigger shapes. The shape is not next to an edge. Is this unambiguous? No, in all of the images, there are two shapes which are small and not next to an edge. I need to look for another commonality between the shapes which are extracted. In example 1, there seems to be a cut-off but scaled-up version of the extracted shape (the purple shapes seem to match the result of scaling up and then cutting off the red shape). In example 2, this is also the case with the pink shape. In example 3, there are large blue bars. Could these the result of scaling up and cutting off the purple shape? The bars are in the bottom left corner. The purple shape is an S shape. If you scale this up and just take the top right corner could it look like 2 horizontal bars with width 2? Yes it could like this. In example 4, the red shape is a scaled-up version of the green shape but cut off by the left edge.

So, the rule seems to be to find the shape which if you were to scale it up and then cut off part of it (with the edge/corner of the grid) it would look like another shape. Then, this shape can be extracted. This shape is always small and not next to an edge. There are always seem to be two possible shapes to extract, so I just need to pick between these.

So the overall rule is:

- Find each shape which isn't next to an edge. We will return the extracted bounding box around one of these shapes.
- Find the shape which is next to an edge/corner of the grid. This shape is cut off by this edge/corner. We'll call this the "edge shape". This might not be a single shape as it might be cut into parts. So, we really need to find the color which is by an edge of the grid. Then we can find a bounding box around this color and use that to locate the overall shape. Of course, the background color is also by an edge, so we'll need to exclude this background color. We can find the background color by finding the most common color. Is the background color always the most common color for all the examples and the additional input? Yes, it is.
- For each shape which isn't next to an edge, try scaling it up and aligning it with the bounding box around the edge shape. We'll need to find a non-cutoff corner of the edge bounding box to align the scaled-up version with.
- The shape next to an edge/corner is cut off, so the scaled-up version we're trying to align will also need to be cut off in the same way. We can cut it off using the bounding box around the edge shape.

If something goes wrong, I should default to picking one of the two shapes which could be extracted. This gives me a chance of getting the right answer by luck.

The output does not have the same shape as the input. The output is always a 3x3 grid.

I'll examine the examples.

Example 1:
- The image consists of some sort of mosaic pattern which has four-fold rotational symmetry.
- There is a single black square which is off-center. It is a 3x3 square. This is a single shape and it is off-center, so this implies the pattern doesn't have four-fold rotational symmetry.
- It seems like the image would have four-fold rotational symmetry except for the black square.
- The 3x3 shape of the black square is the same as the output shape.

Example 2:
- This is also a mosaic pattern which seems to have four-fold rotational symmetry.
- There is a single black square which is off-center and 3x3. This implies there isn't actually four-fold rotational symmetry.
- It seems like this image would have four-fold rotational symmetry except for the black square once again.

Example 3:
- This is a mosaic pattern which seems to have four-fold rotational symmetry.
- There is a single black square which is off-center and 3x3. This implies there isn't actually four-fold rotational symmetry.
- It seems like this image would have four-fold rotational symmetry except for the black square once again.

I need to figure out the transformation rule. It seems like it might have something to do with the 3x3 black square. The colors in the output seem similar to the colors nearby the black square. Could it be something to do with which colors are immediately adjacent to the black square? I'll check the colors adjacent to the black square in example 1.

What is notable about the images which might help me figure out the rule? There is a mosaic pattern. There is always a four-fold symmetry (other than the black square). The black square is always off-center. The black square is always 3x3. The colors in the output seem similar to the colors nearby the black square.

If the four-fold symmetry was important, what would the rule be? One rule could be that the output shows what would be in the location of the black square if it wasn't there and the mosaic was completed. The four-fold symmetry would allow for determining what would be in the location of the black square. In particular, the colors in the output would match what you would get if you mirrored the far side of the grid from the black square over the black square and then read out the 3x3 colors in the position of the square.

This seems like a reasonable guess for the rule, so I will figure out how to implement this and then implement this in code.

How can I implement this?

- First, I need to find the black square.
- Next, I want to determine what side of the grid is the far side from the black square. I can take the middle position of the black square and determine if that row is further from the middle or if that column is further from the middle. Then, if the row is further, I'll mirror vertically, mirroring the half which is on the opposite side as the black square. If the column is further, I'll mirror horizontally, mirroring the half which is on the opposite side as the black square.
- I'll extract out the original position of the 3x3 black square after mirroring.
- I'll return this.

I will now implement this in code.

The output is always a 3x3 grid. The input is an 11x11 grid which consists of 3x3 sub-grids and a purple border. There are 9 3x3 sub-grids in each input. This is true for all of the inputs.

The output is a 3x3 grid and the input consists of a bunch of 3x3 sub-grids. Each of these 3x3 sub-grids within the input consists of a black background and a small number of pink cells. It is just black and pink in every 3x3 sub-grid. So the sub-grids can be interpreted as boolean grids with either pink or not pink (black). The output always has a black background with 2-3 blue cells on a black background. So the output can also be interpreted as a boolean grid. It's possible that the transformation is some sort of element-wise function applied to all of the input 3x3 sub-grids such as AND, OR, XOR, or something more exotic like the output being on if exactly one of the 9 sub-grids has a pink cell in the corresponding position. It could also be something simpler like just taking a specific one of the sub-grids and changing the blue cells to pink.

Another possibility is that rather than some element-wise function of the grids, each cell in the output is produced via a function on the sub-grid in the corresponding location. For instance, the top left cell in the output is produced via some function on the top left sub-grid and so on.

I'll first see if the output could just be one of the sub-grids (e.g. a sub-grid in a particular position) with the blue cells changed to pink. In example 1, there are 3 blue cells in the output. Do any of the sub-grids in example 1 match? I don't think so. Also, I think none of the sub-grids have more than 2 pink cells: they all seem to have either 1 or 2 pink cells. So the output can't be any of the sub-grids with the blue cells changed to pink.

Each of the sub-grids having exactly 1 or 2 pink cells seems notable. It's possible that the transformation is related to this somehow. One possibility would be that the output at position (i, j) is blue if the number of pink cells in the sub-grid at position (i, j) is 2 and black otherwise (when the number is 1). I'll check this on the examples.

In example 1:

- Top left: 2 pink cells
- Top middle: 1 pink cell
- Top right: 2 pink cells
- Middle left: 2 pink cells
- Middle middle: 1 pink cell
- Middle right: 1 pink cell
- Bottom left: 1 pink cell
- Bottom middle: 1 pink cell
- Bottom right: 1 pink cell

Where does the output have blue cells? It has a blue cell in the top left (the corresponding sub-grid has 2 pink cells), in the top right (the corresponding sub-grid has 2 pink cells), and in the middle left (the corresponding sub-grid has 2 pink cells). So, the output has blue cells in the positions where the corresponding sub-grid has 2 pink cells. Are there locations where there are 2 pink cells, but no corresponding blue cell in the output? No. I'll check one more example.

In example 2:

- Top left: 1 pink cell
- Top middle: 1 pink cell
- Top right: 1 pink cell
- Middle left: 1 pink cell
- Middle middle: 1 pink cell
- Middle right: 2 pink cells
- Bottom left: 2 pink cells
- Bottom middle: 1 pink cell
- Bottom right: 1 pink cell

Where does the output have blue cells? It has a blue cell in the middle right (the corresponding sub-grid has 2 pink cells) and in the bottom left (the corresponding sub-grid has 2 pink cells). So, the output has blue cells in the positions where the corresponding sub-grid has 2 pink cells. Are there locations where there are 2 pink cells, but no corresponding blue cell in the output? No.

So this seems to be the transformation rule.

The rule is:

- Find all the 3x3 sub-grids within the 11x11 input. This can be done by cutting the input into 3x3 sub-grids while removing the purple border between cells (that makes it 11x11 rather than 9x9).
- For each of these sub-grids, count the number of pink cells.
- The output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is blue if the corresponding sub-grid has 2 pink cells and black otherwise.

I will now implement this in code.

The output does not have the same shape as the input. In this case, it appears that the output is a subset of the input.

I'll examine each input in detail.

Example 1:

- Based on the normalized shape representation, the red shape in the output is the same as the red shape in the input (though its absolute position differs).
- The output seems to be the subset of the input which extracts the red (color 2) shape in the input. It keeps the blue (color 1) background cells within the red shape.
- The background is blue.
- There is also a green (color 3) shape and a few purple (color 8) shapes in the input. These shapes aren't transferred to the output as they aren't in the corresponding rectangle which is extracted.
- The green shape seems similar in style to a rotated version of the red shape, though it differs.
- Both the red shape and the green shape have bilateral symmetry.
- The purple shapes appear to be the result of cutting off a scaled-up version of the red shape. This cuts it into parts. It is cut off by the bottom edge.

Example 2:

- The yellow shape in the output is the same as the yellow shape in the input (though its absolute position differs).
- The output extracts the bounding box around the yellow shape.
- The background is purple.
- There is a green shape and a partially cut-off pink shape in the input. They aren't in the corresponding bounding box, so they aren't transferred to the output.
- The green shape appears to be a rotated version of the yellow shape.
- The pink shape appears to be a scaled-up version of the yellow shape though it is cut off by the bottom corner.

Example 3:

- The purple shape in the output is the same as the purple shape in the input (though its absolute position differs).
- The output extracts the bounding box around the purple shape.
- The background is red.
- There is a green shape and two blue shapes in the bottom right. They aren't transferred to the output.
- The blue shapes are bars.

Example 4:

- The green shape in the output is the same as the green shape in the input (though its absolute position differs).
- The output extracts the bounding box around the green shape.
- The background is blue
- There is a red shape and a purple shape in the input. They aren't transferred to the output.
- The red shape appears to be a scaled-up version of the green shape but cut off by the left edge.

The transformation rule seems to extract the bounding box around one of the shapes. I need to determine which shape it extracts.

What do I notice about the shape it extracts? The shape is small rather than one of the bigger shapes. The shape is not next to an edge. Is this unambiguous? No, in all of the images, there are two shapes which are small and not next to an edge. I need to look for another commonality between the shapes which are extracted. In example 1, there seems to be a cut-off but scaled-up version of the extracted shape (the purple shapes seem to match the result of scaling up and then cutting off the red shape). In example 2, this is also the case with the pink shape. In example 3, there are large blue bars. Could these the result of scaling up and cutting off the purple shape? The bars are in the bottom left corner. The purple shape is an S shape. If you scale this up and just take the top right corner could it look like 2 horizontal bars with width 2? Yes it could like this. In example 4, the red shape is a scaled-up version of the green shape but cut off by the left edge.

So, the rule seems to be to find the shape which if you were to scale it up and then cut off part of it (with the edge/corner of the grid) it would look like another shape. Then, this shape can be extracted. This shape is always small and not next to an edge. There are always seem to be two possible shapes to extract, so I just need to pick between these.

So the overall rule is:

- Find each shape which isn't next to an edge. We will return the extracted bounding box around one of these shapes.
- Find the shape which is next to an edge/corner of the grid. This shape is cut off by this edge/corner. We'll call this the "edge shape". This might not be a single shape as it might be cut into parts. So, we really need to find the color which is by an edge of the grid. Then we can find a bounding box around this color and use that to locate the overall shape. Of course, the background color is also by an edge, so we'll need to exclude this background color. We can find the background color by finding the most common color. Is the background color always the most common color for all the examples and the additional input? Yes, it is.
- For each shape which isn't next to an edge, try scaling it up and aligning it with the bounding box around the edge shape. We'll need to find a non-cutoff corner of the edge bounding box to align the scaled-up version with.
- The shape next to an edge/corner is cut off, so the scaled-up version we're trying to align will also need to be cut off in the same way. We can cut it off using the bounding box around the edge shape.

If something goes wrong, I should default to picking one of the two shapes which could be extracted. This gives me a chance of getting the right answer by luck.

The output does not have the same shape as the input. The output is always a 3x3 grid.

I'll examine the examples.

Example 1:
- The image consists of some sort of mosaic pattern which has four-fold rotational symmetry.
- There is a single black which is off-center. Based on the normalized shape representation, it is a 3x3 square. This is a single shape and it is off-center, so this implies the pattern doesn't have four-fold rotational symmetry.
- It seems like the image would have four-fold rotational symmetry except for the black square.
- The 3x3 shape of the black square is the same as the output shape.

Example 2:
- This is also a mosaic pattern which seems to have four-fold rotational symmetry.
- There is a single black square which is off-center and 3x3. This implies there isn't actually four-fold rotational symmetry.
- It seems like this image would have four-fold rotational symmetry except for the black square once again.

Example 3:
- This is a mosaic pattern which seems to have four-fold rotational symmetry.
- There is a single black square which is off-center and 3x3. This implies there isn't actually four-fold rotational symmetry.
- It seems like this image would have four-fold rotational symmetry except for the black square once again.

I need to figure out the transformation rule. It seems like it might have something to do with the 3x3 black square. The colors in the output seem similar to the colors nearby the black square.

What is notable about the images which might help me figure out the rule? There is a mosaic pattern. There is always a four-fold symmetry (other than the black square). The black square is always off-center. The black square is always 3x3. The colors in the output seem similar to the colors nearby the black square.

If the four-fold symmetry was important, what would the rule be? One rule could be that the output shows what would be in the location of the black square if it wasn't there and the mosaic was completed. The four-fold symmetry would allow for determining what would be in the location of the black square. In particular, the colors in the output would match what you would get if you mirrored the far side of the grid from the black square over the black square and then read out the 3x3 colors in the position of the square.

This seems like a reasonable guess for the rule, so I will figure out how to implement this and then implement this in code.

How can I implement this?

- First, I need to find the black square.
- Next, I want to determine what side of the grid is the far side from the black square. I can take the middle position of the black square and determine if that row is further from the middle or if that column is further from the middle. Then, if the row is further, I'll mirror vertically, mirroring the half which is on the opposite side as the black square. If the column is further, I'll mirror horizontally, mirroring the half which is on the opposite side as the black square.
- I'll extract out the original position of the 3x3 black square after mirroring.
- I'll return this.

I will now implement this in code.

The output is always a 3x3 grid. The input is an 11x11 grid which consists of 3x3 sub-grids and a purple border. There are 9 3x3 sub-grids in each input. This is true for all of the inputs.

The output is a 3x3 grid and the input consists of a bunch of 3x3 sub-grids. Each of these 3x3 sub-grids within the input consists of a black background and a small number of pink cells. It is just black and pink in every 3x3 sub-grid. So the sub-grids can be interpreted as boolean grids with either pink or not pink (black). The output always has a black background with 2-3 blue cells on a black background. So the output can also be interpreted as a boolean grid. It's possible that the transformation is some sort of element-wise function applied to all of the input 3x3 sub-grids such as AND, OR, XOR, or something more exotic like the output being on if exactly one of the 9 sub-grids has a pink cell in the corresponding position. It could also be something simpler like just taking a specific one of the sub-grids and changing the blue cells to pink.

Another possibility is that rather than some element-wise function of the grids, each cell in the output is produced via a function on the sub-grid in the corresponding location. For instance, the top left cell in the output is produced via some function on the top left sub-grid and so on.

I'll first see if the output could just be one of the sub-grids (e.g. a sub-grid in a particular position) with the blue cells changed to pink. In example 1, there are 3 blue cells in the output. Do any of the sub-grids in example 1 match? I don't think so. Also, I think none of the sub-grids have more than 2 pink cells: they all seem to have either 1 or 2 pink cells. So the output can't be any of the sub-grids with the blue cells changed to pink.

Each of the sub-grids having exactly 1 or 2 pink cells seems notable. It's possible that the transformation is related to this somehow. One possibility would be that the output at position (i, j) is blue if the number of pink cells in the sub-grid at position (i, j) is 2 and black otherwise (when the number is 1). I'll check this on the examples.

In example 1:

- A1 in the output corresponds to the top left sub-grid in the input. The top left sub-grid has corners A1, C1, A3, and C3. I can check for pink cells with a location within these corners (the upper bounds are inclusive). Which pink cells are within this sub-grid (as defined by these corners)? I can check this sub-grid using the color representation for pink. The matching pink cells: A2, C3. There are 2 pink cells. Now I'll check what color A1 is in the output. A1 in the output is a blue cell.
- I'll use the same reasoning approach as in the prior bullet, but in a more terse fashion. B1 corresponds to the top middle sub-grid. There is a purple border separating the sub-grids, so the sub-grid has corners E1, G1, E3, G3. The matching pink cells: F2. There is 1 pink cell. B1 in the output is black.
- C1 corresponds to the top right sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners I1, K1, I3, K3. The matching pink cells: K2, J3. There are 2 pink cells. C1 in the output is blue.
- A2 corresponds to the middle left sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners A5, C5, A7, C7. The matching pink cells: B5 and B7. There are 2 pink cells. A2 in the output is blue.
- B2 corresponds to the middle middle sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners E5, G5, E7, G7. The matching pink cells: G5. There is 1 pink cell. B2 in the output is black.
- C2 corresponds to the middle right sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners I5, K5, I7, K7. The matching pink cells: I7. There is 1 pink cell. C2 in the output is black.
- A3 corresponds to the bottom left sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners A9, C9, A11, C11. The matching pink cells: C9. There is 1 pink cell. A3 in the output is black.
- B3 corresponds to the bottom middle sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners E9, G9, E11, G11. The matching pink cells: E11. There is 1 pink cell. B3 in the output is black.
- C3 corresponds to the bottom right sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners I9, K9, I11, K11. The matching pink cells: J10. There is 1 pink cell. C3 in the output is black.

In cases where the output is blue, the corresponding sub-grid has 2 pink cells in all cases. In cases where the output is black, the corresponding sub-grid has 1 pink cell. So, in this example, the output is blue if the corresponding sub-grid has 2 pink cells and black otherwise.

I'll check one more example.

In example 2:

- A1 corresponds to the top left sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners A1, C1, A3, C3. The matching pink cells: A1. There is 1 pink cell. A1 in the output is black.
- B1 corresponds to the top middle sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners E1, G1, E3, G3. The matching pink cells: G2. There is 1 pink cell. B1 in the output is black.
- C1 corresponds to the top right sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners I1, K1, I3, K3. The matching pink cells: K2. There is 1 pink cell. C1 in the output is black.
- A2 corresponds to the middle left sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners A5, C5, A7, C7. The matching pink cells: A5. There is 1 pink cell. A2 in the output is black.
- B2 corresponds to the middle middle sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners E5, G5, E7, G7. The matching pink cells: G7. There is 1 pink cell. B2 in the output is black.
- C2 corresponds to the middle right sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners I5, K5, I7, K7. The matching pink cells: J6, I7. There are 2 pink cells. C2 in the output is blue.
- A3 corresponds to the bottom left sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners A9, C9, A11, C11. The matching pink cells: A10, B11. There are 2 pink cells. A3 in the output is blue.
- B3 corresponds to the bottom middle sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners E9, G9, E11, G11. The matching pink cells: F11. There is 1 pink cell. B3 in the output is black.
- C3 corresponds to the bottom right sub-grid. The sub-grid has corners I9, K9, I11, K11. The matching pink cells: K11. There is 1 pink cell. C3 in the output is black.

In cases where the output is blue, the corresponding sub-grid has 2 pink cells in all cases. In cases where the output is black, the corresponding sub-grid has 1 pink cell. This also follows the hypothesized transformation rule.

The rule is:

- Find all the 3x3 sub-grids within the 11x11 input. This can be done by cutting the input into 3x3 sub-grids while removing the purple border between cells (that makes it 11x11 rather than 9x9).
- For each of these sub-grids, count the number of pink cells.
- The output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is blue if the corresponding sub-grid has 2 pink cells and black otherwise.

I will now implement this in code.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in each example to infer the transformation rule. 

Example 1:
- The grey cells remained the same.
- The blue cells remained the same.
- The orange cells remained the same.
- The purple cells remained the same.
- Some pink cells (F6, G6) were replaced with grey cells.

Example 2:
- The grey cells remained the same.
- The green cells remained the same.
- The orange cells remained the same.
- The purple cells remained the same.
- Some brown cells (I8, H9) were replaced with grey cells.

Example 3:
- The grey cells remained the same.
- The yellow cells remained the same.
- The green cells remained the same.
- Some blue cells (H1, G2, H2, I2) were replaced with grey cells.

In all examples, the rule seems to be the following:
- Identifiable shapes (including colors grey, blue, orange, yellow, green, brown, and purple) remain unchanged.
- Some identifiable shapes (pink cells in Example 1, brown cells in Example 2, and blue cells in Example 3) are replaced with grey cells.

Identifiable shapes are replaced with grey cells. These shapes are identifiable by a unique color. I need to implement the rule to replace identifiable shapes with grey cells.

To implement the rule, I will:
- Identify all unique shapes in the input grid.
- Replace cells of identifiable shapes with grey cells.

I'll analyze each of the examples to determine the issue. I need to examine the differences between the actual output from the previous implementation and the expected output. Once I understand the differences and what is generally going on, I'll try to determine the issue.

Example 1:

- The expected output has blue at A1 B1 B2 C2 C3, but the actual output puts grey at those cells. This is the only difference between the expected and actual outputs. (Based on the color differences section.)
- What was at A1 B1 B2 C2 C3 in the input for example 1? In input 1, these cells were blue. Based on the location by color representation for input 1, these are all of the cells for the blue shape in the input.
- The actual output changed all of these blue cells to grey. So it seems like the implementation replaced the cells of the blue shape with grey. This is incorrect; the expected output has the blue shape unchanged.

Example 2:

- Correct.

Example 3:

- The expected output has pink at B8 C8 D8 C9, but the actual output puts grey at those cells. This is the only difference between the expected and actual outputs.
- What was at B8 C8 D8 C9 in the input for example 2? In input 1, these cells were pink. Based on the location by color representation for input 1, these are all of the cells for the pink shape in the input.
- The actual output changed all of these pink cells to grey. So it seems like the implementation replaced the cells of the pink shape with grey. This is incorrect; the expected output has the pink shape unchanged.

In examples 1 and 3, some shape is incorrectly replaced with grey. In each example, only one shape should be replaced with grey. The previous implementation takes any shape with colors [6, 9, 1] (pink, brown, blue) and replaces it with grey. These colors should not always be replaced with grey. It seems like the implementation special cases these colors which probably isn't correct.

The rule involves selecting some shape and replacing it with grey. Only one shape is replaced in all examples. So, the key question is how to determine which shape should be replaced in a given input. I'll investigate commonalities between which shape should be replaced in each example.

Example 1:

- The pink shape is replaced. What are some properties of this shape? The normalized shape representation is A1 B1 B2 C2 C3 which means the shape takes up 5 cells. It spans from A to C and 1 to 3 which means it has a 3x3 bounding box. This normalized shape representation is the same as that of the blue shape in the input for this example. For the 3x3 bounding box, the shape fills 5/9 of the cells. The pink shape is in the bottom right of the grid.

Example 2:

- The brown shape is replaced. What are some properties of this shape? The normalized shape representation is B1 A2 B2 which means the shape takes up 3 cells and is in a (A to B and 1 to 2) 2x2 bounding box. This normalized shape representation is the same as that of the green shape in the input for this example. For the 2x2 bounding box, the shape fills 3/4 of the cells. The brown shape is in the bottom right of the grid.

Example 3:

- The blue shape is replaced. What are some properties of this shape? The normalized shape representation is B1 A2 B2 C2 which means the shape takes up 4 cells and is in a (A to B and 1 to 3) 2x3 bounding box. This normalized shape representation is the same as that of the yellow shape in the input for this example. For the 2x3 bounding box, the shape fills 4/6 of the cells. The blue shape is in the top right of the grid.

What are salient commonalities between the shape which should be replaced? The normalized shape representation of these shapes which should be replaced is the same as that of another shape in the input, so the shape which should be replaced is equivalent to some other shape (but with a different color and translation). The rule could be to replace the shape which is equal in shape to another shape in the input. I should check for each example whether this proposed rule incorrectly replaces any shapes.

In example 1, what other shapes are equal in shape to some shape? The blue shape is equal in shape to the pink shape, so there is another shape which is equivalent. If one shape is equal to another shape, then there will always be at least two equal shapes (trivially). So, the proposed rule isn't correct. It could be that the rule has an additional condition for replacement. That is, the shape which is replaced has to be equal to some other shape (or perhaps some particular shape) and must also have some other property. I can analyze this by finding which shapes are equal in example 1 and then examining their properties.

Which shapes are equal in example 1? I know that the blue and pink shapes are equal (in shape). I can check the other colors. For orange, there are two shapes with normalized representations: H1 G2 H2 I2 H3| A7 B7 C7 C8. Are either of these shapes equal to any other shapes? No. For purple, there is a shape with normalized representation: E9 D10 E10 F10 G10. Is this shape equal to some other shape? No. So, the only equalities are the blue and the pink shape. Is there anything distinctive about either the pink or blue shapes to indicate they should/shouldn't be replaced? The blue shape is surrounded by a grey outline in the top left. No other shape in this image is surrounded by a grey outline. So, something to do with the grey outline could be important. I'll analyze the other examples.

- In the other examples (2 and 3) and in the additional input, there is also a shape surrounded by a grey outline.
- In example 2, the green shape is in the top left surrounded by a grey outline. Grey doesn't occur elsewhere in the image.
- In example 3, the yellow shape is in the top left surrounded by a grey outline. Grey doesn't occur elsewhere in the image.
- In example 2, the brown shape which should be replaced is equal in shape to the green shape and this green shape is surrounded by a grey outline. So, the brown shape is equal in shape to the shape in the grey outline.
- In example 3, the blue shape which should be replaced is equal in shape to the yellow shape and this yellow shape is surrounded by a grey outline. So, the brown shape is equal in shape to the shape in the grey outline.

It seems that in each case, the shape which should be replaced is equal in shape to the shape in the grey outline. So, the rule is to replace the shape which is equal in shape to the shape in the grey outline.

The exact transformation is:

1. Locate the colored shape in the grey outline. The color of this shape is non-grey and non-black. This shape can be found by finding the bounding box of grey and then looking for a non-grey and non-black color which is within this bounding box. We then want to get the indices of this shape.
2. Then, find a shape which is equal in shape to this colored shape in the grey outline. We can check for equal shapes by first normalizing the shapes and then comparing the sorted indices. When looking for another shape which is equal in shape, we need this other shape to be distinct from the shape in the grey outline. That is, we need to avoid finding the same shape as we got from step (1) here.
3. Replace the cells of the shape that we found in step (2) with grey.

I will now implement this rule in code.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in detail for each of the examples to infer the transformation rule. I'll also describe the input for each example.

- In the input, there is a purple rectangle with a hole in the center containing 4 different colors: yellow, green, red, and pink.
- In the output, the purple rectangle remains intact with its hole in the center; however, the colors inside this hole have moved out to the corners surrounding the purple rectangle.
- The pink color moved to position C2, the red color moved to H2, the green color moved to C8, and the yellow color moved to H8.
- It seems that the colors inside the hole in the purple shape are moved to the corners of the bounding box around the purple shape.

- In the output, the orange rectangle remains intact with its hole in the center; however, the colors inside this hole have moved to the corners surrounding the orange rectangle.
- The red color moved to I9, the brown color moved to I2, the green color moved to B2, and the purple color moved to B9.

In Example 3:

- In the input, there is a blue rectangle with a hole in the center containing 4 different colors: red, green, pink, and grey.
- In the output, the blue rectangle remains intact with its hole in the center; however, the colors inside this hole have moved to the corners surrounding the blue rectangle.
- The green color moved to A1, the pink color moved to H1, the grey color moved to A7, and the red color moved to H7.
- Again, it seems the rule holds: the colors inside the hole in the blue shape are moved to the corners of the bounding box around the blue shape.

In the additional input we can apply the same rule:

- There is a green rectangle with a hole in the center containing 4 different colors: pink, yellow, purple, and red.
- According to the rule, pink will move to one corner, yellow to another, purple to another, and red to the remaining corner of the bounding box around the green rectangle.

I can now articulate the transformation rule:

1. Identify a colored rectangle with a hole in the center (treated as one shape).
2. Find the bounding box around this rectangle.
3. Move the colors inside the hole to the corners of the bounding box around the rectangle, maintaining their original color.

I will now implement this rule in code.

I'll analyze the incorrect outputs and the expected outputs to determine the issue. I'll examine the differences, try to understand what's going on, and then try to determine the issue.

In Example 1:

- C8 should have been green (3) but the actual output has it as pink (6).
- C2 should have been pink (6) but the actual output has it as green (3).
- Based on the color differences, these are the only differences.
- The red (2) cell was moved to H2 and this is correct.
- The yellow (4) cell was moved to H8 and this is correct.
- C8 is the location where pink should have gone, so it is a location where some cell from inside the rectangle should go. The cell that went there is green instead of pink which is incorrect.
- C2 is the location where green should have gone, so it is a location where some cell from inside the rectangle should go but it should have been the green cell instead of the pink cell.
- It seems like the cells are being moved to locations where some cell from inside the rectangle should go, but aren't always being moved to the location which is correct for that cell.

In Example 2:

- I9 should have been red but the actual output has it as green.
- B2 should have been green but the actual output has it as brown (9).
- B9 should have been purple (8) but the actual output has it as red.
- I2 should have been brown but the actual output has it as purple.
- The issue seems to be the same type of issue as in Example 1.

In Example 3:

- A1 should have been green but the actual output has it as grey (5).
- A7 should have been grey but the actual output has it as pink.
- H1 should have been pink but the actual output has it as green.
- The issue seems to be the same type of issue as in Example 1 and Example 2.

So, the cells are being moved to the corners around the rectangle which is correct, but they are being put in the wrong corner. For each example, I'll analyze what position inside the rectangle each cell starts with and which corner it is supposed to end up at.

In Example 1:

- The red cell starts at E6. How does this position relate to the rectangle? The rectangle has a bounding box of D3 G3 D7 G7. The red cell starts in the bottom left corner of the interior of the rectangle (within the border). The red cell ends up at H2 which is the top right corner surrounding the rectangle. That is, the location which is one above and one to the right of the corresponding corner of the rectangle (G3). This corner is the opposite corner from where it starts.
- The green cell starts at F4. The green cell starts in the top right corner of the interior of the rectangle. The green cell ends up at C8 which is the bottom left corner surrounding the rectangle. This is the opposite corner from where it starts.
- The yellow cell starts at E4. The yellow cell starts in the top left corner of the interior of the rectangle. The yellow cell ends up at H8 which is the bottom right corner surrounding the rectangle. This is the opposite corner from where it starts.
- The pink cell starts at F6. The pink cell starts in the bottom right corner of the interior of the rectangle. The pink cell ends up at C2 which is the top left corner surrounding the rectangle. This is the opposite corner from where it starts.

It seems like the rule is to move the cells to the opposite corner from where they start. I'll check this is also the case for the next example.

In Example 2:

- The rectangle has a bounding box of C3 H3 C8 H8.
- The red cell starts at D4. The red cell starts in the top left corner of the interior of the rectangle. The red cell ends up at I9 which is the bottom right corner surrounding the rectangle. This is the opposite corner from where it starts.
- The green cell starts at G7. The green cell starts in the bottom right corner of the interior of the rectangle. The green cell ends up at B2 which is the top left corner surrounding the rectangle. This is the opposite corner from where it starts.
- The purple cell starts at G4. The purple cell starts in the top right corner of the interior of the rectangle. The purple cell ends up at B9 which is the bottom left corner surrounding the rectangle. This is the opposite corner from where it starts.
- The brown cell starts at D7. The brown cell starts in the bottom left corner of the interior of the rectangle. The brown cell ends up at I2 which is the top right corner surrounding the rectangle. This is the opposite corner from where it starts.

Example 2 also seems to follow this rule.

The revised rule description is:

1. Identify a colored rectangle with a hole in the center (treated as one shape).
2. Find the bounding box around this rectangle.
3. Move the colors inside the hole to the corners of the bounding box around the rectangle, maintaining their original color.
4. Each colored cell inside the rectangle is at a corner of the interior of the rectangle and is moved to the opposite corner from where it starts. For each colored cell inside the rectangle, we can find the closest corner of the rectangle and then determine what the opposite corner is.

I will now implement this rule in code.

Observing the examples, I notice the following differences between the input and output grids:

1. In example 1, a vertical red line is added in column I and a horizontal red line is added in row 9.
2. In example 2, a vertical red line is added in columns E and K.
3. In example 3, a vertical red line is added in column B and a horizontal red line is added in row 3 and 13.

The outputs always have the same shape as the inputs. The outputs are similar to the inputs, but some edits have been made.

I'll describe the changes from the input to the output in detail for each example to infer the transformation rule. I'll also describe the input for each example.

Example 1:

- There is a black background.
- In both the input and output, there is exactly one purple (color 8) cell. The purple cell does not move.
- The output has grey (color 5) cells that did not exist in the input. These grey cells form a Z-shaped pattern with the purple cell at its center and they replace some of the black cells.
  
The grey cells are located as follows:
  - G1
  - E2, F2, G2
  - E3
  - E5
  - C6, D6, E6
  - C7
  - A8, B8, C8
  - A9
  - A10
  - The purple cell is itself present at E4.

Example 2:

- There is a black background.
- In both the input and output, there is exactly one purple (color 8) cell. The purple cell does not move.
- The output has grey (color 5) cells that did not exist in the input. These grey cells form a Z-shaped pattern with the purple cell at its center and they replace some of the black cells.

The grey cells are located as follows:
  - M1
  - K2, L2, M2
  - K3
  - I4, J4, K4
  - I5
  - G6, H6, I6
  - G7
  - G9
  - E10, F10, G10
  - E11
  - C12, D12, E12
  - C13

As the grey cells are added forming a Z-shaped pattern with the purple cell at its center, it appears the purple cell retains its position as the center of some kind of elongated Z shape. The "Z" is 3 cells wide.

I now understand the transformation rule:

1. Identify the single purple cell.
2. Replace black cells with grey cells to form a Z-shape centered at the purple cell. The "Z" is 3 cells wide, 13 cells high and rotates around the purple cell.

Now I will implement this in the code.

Based on the color differences section for example 1, there are some cells in the actual output which should have been black which are grey and some cells which should have been grey which are black. Example 1 doesn't have other differences beyond the grey and black cell issues.

Example 2 swaps grey and black similarly to example 1 and doesn't have other differences.

Example 3 swaps grey and black similarly to example 1 and doesn't have other differences.

It looks like the added grey cells in the correct output form some sort of pattern which goes up and to the right from the purple shape and down and to the left from the purple shape. The location by color representation indicates two grey shapes in the correct output, so these components are disconnected.

It looks like the components continue until they reach the edge of the grid.

I'll analyze the larger of the two components for example 1.

- This component is E5 C6 D6 E6 C7 A8 B8 C8 A9 A10.
- The purple cell is E4.
- So, E5 is directly below E4 and this is the start of the component.
- What is adjacent to E5? E6 is the only adjacent cell.
- What else is adjacent to E6? D6 is the only adjacent cell.
- What else is adjacent to D6? C6 is the only adjacent cell.
- I'll list adjacent cells until I hit all the cells or reach a cell which presents multiple next cells.
- E5 E6 D6 C6 C7 C8 B8 A8 A9 A10.
- So, it starts at E5 then down to E6, then left to D6, then left to C6, then down to C7, then down to C8, then left to B8, then left to A8, then down to A9, then down to A10. So, it goes left twice and then down twice and so on. This repeats until it reaches the edge of the grid.
- The component above the purple cell goes up and to the right, so it probably goes up twice and then right twice and so on. I'll double-check this by analyzing the other component in example 1.

Other component analysis:

- The other component in example 1 is G1 E2 F2 G2 E3.
- The purple cell is E4 so the component starts at E3 which is above the purple cell.
- I'll list the cells in adjacency order.
- E3 E2 F2 G2 G1.
- It starts at E3 then up to E2, then right to F2, then right to G2, then up to G1. So, it goes up twice and then right twice. I don't see any full repetitions because this component hits the edge too soon. I should analyze a grey component which goes up and is reasonably big. Example 2 has such a component.

Example 2 up and right component analysis:

- The purple cell is G8.
- So, the cell above is G7. This is a grey cell as expected. I'll write out the adjacency list.
- G7 G6 H6 I6 I5 I4 J4 K4 K3 K2 L2 M2 M1.
- It goes up to G6 then right to H6 then right to I6 then up to I5 then up to I4 then right to J4 then right to K4 then up to K3 then up to K2. Ok, so it seems like it goes up twice and then right twice and so on.

So, the rule is that grey cells are added (replacing black cells) to form a line which goes up and to the right from the purple cell and down and to the left from the purple cell. It starts by going up/down 1, then goes 2 to the right/left, then goes 2 up/down, and so on. This pattern repeats until it hits the edge of the grid.

So, the revised rule is:

1. Identify the single purple cell.
2. Replace black cells with grey cells to form 2 lines: a line going up and to the right from the purple cell and a line going down and to the left from the purple cell. The lines start by going up/down 1, then go 2 to the right/left, then go 2 up/down, and so on.
3. This can be implemented by repeating the pattern up, right, right, up starting with adding the first "up" immediately above the purple cell. The next up would be added immediately on top of the last running cell. The other direction can be implemented similarly but with down, left, left, down.
4. This will need to be cut off when it reaches the edge of the grid.

I will now implement this rule in code.

The outputs do not have the same shape as the inputs, but they have a clear relationship with certain parts of the input. Let's analyze the transformations step by step to see if we can deduce a consistent rule.

In each example, there are small colored blocks located on the edges which seem to be used in the output. The outputs appear to be a combination of these colored blocks arranged in a certain pattern.

From the examples:

**Example 1:**
- The input has small colored blocks in the top-left corner in a 2x2 grid.
- The output is a 6x6 grid where each of the four colors from the 2x2 block is used to create a center-cross pattern in four quadrants.

**Example 2:**
- The input has small colored blocks in the top-right corner in a 2x2 grid.
- The output is a 6x6 grid where each of the four colors from the 2x2 block is used to create a center-cross pattern in four quadrants.

**Example 3:**
- The input has small colored blocks in the bottom-left corner in a 2x2 grid.
- The output is a 6x6 grid where each of the four colors from the 2x2 block is used to create a center-cross pattern in four quadrants.

These observations suggest a pattern:

The small 2x2 block of colors in the input is replicated to create a cross pattern in four quadrants in the output. The specific quadrant in the input determines the position and arrangement of the colors in each quadrant of the output.

The transformation rule appears to be:
1. Identify the 2x2 block of colors located within the input.
2. For each color in this 2x2 block, use it to generate a center-cross pattern in the 6x6 output grid such that each color occupies a quadrant of the 6x6 grid.

I'll now write the code to implement this transformation.

The implementation is correct for example 1, but wrong for examples 2 and 3. I'll examine these examples where the implementation is incorrect to determine the issue.

Example 2:

- The actual output produced by the implementation has a center-cross pattern in the four quadrants.
- The expected output doesn't have center-cross patterns in the four quadrants. The colors of the non-black cells within the quadrants match the actual output, but the patterns aren't center-cross patterns. So, the transformation rule isn't to create center-cross patterns. In example 1, the input involves center-cross patterns, but this isn't the case for all inputs. This might explain why the center-cross approach works for example 1 but not for example 2 and example 3.

Example 3:

- The actual output produced by the implementation has a center-cross pattern in the four quadrants.
- The expected output doesn't have center-cross patterns in the four quadrants though the colors of the quadrants do match the actual output.

So, the issue is that the rule isn't to create center-cross patterns in the four quadrants but instead to create some other shapes. The coloration of the non-black cells in each quadrant seems correct.

I need to determine what the rule is for determining what shapes are in the output.

In example 1, there are 4 center-cross patterns in the input in the bottom right side. The shape matches the shapes in the output, though the colors are changed as discussed earlier. So, for this example, the output can be created by copying from the 6x6 in the bottom right corner and then coloring the non-black cells according to the colors in the 2x2 block.

In example 2, it seems like the pattern in the bottom left 6x6 of the input is copied to the output. The colors are changed, but the shapes are the same. The bottom left is the opposite corner from the top right where the 2x2 block is located. In the prior example, the bottom right is the opposite corner from the top left where the 2x2 block is located. So, it seems like the output is created by copying the 6x6 from the opposite corner of the 2x2 block.

I'll also check example 3. In example 3, the 2x2 is in the bottom left. Does the pattern in the top right 6x6 of the input match the output? Yes, it does. The colors are changed, but the shapes are the same. So, it seems like the output is created by copying the 6x6 from the opposite corner of the 2x2 block.

Could there be any other issues with the implementation? We've identified an issue with the pattern it puts in the output and determined how to solve this. It seems like the coloring of the quadrants is correct. The other aspect is locating the 2x2. The implementation finds the 2x2 by looking for a corner without black cells. Could there be a case where a corner that isn't the 2x2 block has no black cells? The pattern which is opposite the 2x2 block could potentially have no black cells in the corner. Does this fail in practice? I'll check if the 6x6 pattern has no black cells in the corner opposite the 2x2 block in each example. Does example 1 have black cells in this opposite corner? Yes. Does example 2 have black cells in this opposite corner? Yes. Does example 3 have black cells in this opposite corner? Yes. Does the additional input have black cells in this opposite corner? Yes. So, this doesn't seem to be an issue. I'll keep the current approach to finding the 2x2 block.

So, the revised rule is:

1. Identify the 2x2 block of colors located within the input.
2. Copy the 6x6 grid from the opposite corner of the 2x2 block.
3. Color the non-black cells in the copied grid according to the colors in the 2x2 block. Each 3x3 quadrant in the copied grid should have its colored cells changed to match the color of the corresponding cell in the 2x2 block.

I'll now implement this rule in code.

To determine the transformation rule, let's examine the input/output pairs in detail.

1. Input 1:
   - Different colored shapes are scattered around.
   - The shape colors are green (3), red (2), and purple (8).
   - The output is a vertical list of colors: green, red, purple.

2. Input 2:
   - Colorful shapes are scattered around.
   - Shape colors are blue (1), red (2), and orange (7).
   - The output is a vertical list of colors: blue, orange, red.

3. Input 3:
   - Colorful shapes are scattered around.
   - Shape colors are yellow (4), red (2), and blue (1).
   - The output is a vertical list of colors: yellow, red, blue.

4. Additional Input:
   - Colorful shapes are scattered around.
   - Shape colors are green (3), blue (1), and pink (6).
   - The output should be a vertical list of colors: green, blue, pink.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule is:
- Extract all the distinct colors of the shapes present, in the order they appear from top to bottom.
- The final result should be a vertical list with each color representing one shape.

Let's implement the transformation in code.

The approach:
1. Traverse the grid and find all unique colors.
2. Add the colors to the output in the order they appear from top to bottom.

I will now write the code.

def solve(input_matrix):

        for cell in row:
            if cell != 0 and cell not in seen_colors:
                seen_colors.add(cell)
                colors_in_order.append(cell)

    # Output will be a list of lists where each list is a row with one color
    return [[color] for color in colors_in_order]

The implementation is correct for the first example, but incorrect for the other examples. I'll analyze the incorrect examples to determine the issue.

Example 2:

- The implementation returned a 3x1 column which matches the expected output.
- The set of 3 colors in this column (2, 1, 7) is the same as the set of colors in the expected output, but the order differs.

Example 3:

- The implementation returned a 3x1 column which matches the expected output.
- The set of 3 colors in this column (2, 4, 1) is the same as the set of colors in the expected output, but the order differs.

It seems like the order isn't determined based on the order of the colors from top to bottom. Something else must determine the order in the output column. I should analyze salient properties of the colored shapes which might determine the order.

- Perhaps the order in the column corresponds to the order of heights of the lowest or highest part of each shape. I'll check this in example 1. I'll start with the ordering being based on the highest part of each shape. Green is the top color in the expected output. Is the highest part of the green shape the highest overall? Yes. Red is next. Is the highest part of the red shape the highest overall? No. Red is strictly below both other shapes. It is in the middle in the output, so any rule based on height ordering is ruled out.
- Perhaps the order in the column corresponds to the left to right ordering of the colors. As in, which shape comes next in this left to right ordering determines what color is next. In example 1, green is first in the output. Is green the leftmost shape? Yes, its left side comes first. Red is next. Is red the leftmost shape after green? Yes, it comes next. Purple is last. Is purple further right than red? Yes, it is the rightmost shape. So far, this rule seems to work. I'll check the next example. In example 2, blue is first. Is blue the leftmost shape? No. So this rule is wrong. Could it be the opposite ordering? (The order in the column corresponds to the right to left ordering.) In example 1, the opposite ordering worked and purple (the last in the column) is furthest right. So the opposite ordering also can't be right.
- What are other non-location properties of shapes which define an ordering? Size, height, and width all can define an ordering. Rotation or some other property of the geometry could define an ordering.
- I'll try size. In example 1, green is first. Is green the largest shape? Yes. Red is next. Is red the second largest shape? Yes. Purple is last. Is purple the smallest shape? Yes. I'll check the next example. In example 2, blue is first. Is blue the largest shape? Yes. Orange is next. Is orange the second largest shape? Yes. Red is last. Is red the smallest shape? Yes. I'll check the next example. In example 3, yellow is first. Is yellow the largest shape? Yes. Red is next. Is red the second largest shape? Yes. Blue is last. Is blue the smallest shape? Yes. This rule seems to work for all examples. The ordering is based on the size of the shapes.

So, the revised rule is:

1. Count the number of cells with each distinct non-black color in the input.
2. Order the colors in the output column based on the number of cells with that color in the input. The color with the most cells should be at the top of the column, followed by the color with the second most cells, and so on.

I'll now implement this rule in code.
