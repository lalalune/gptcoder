def solve(input_grid):
    """
    Function to solve the ARC AGI grid problem.
    
    The function takes a 2D list as input and the operation it performs can be 
    summarized as follows:
    - Duplicate the input grid's rows and append them to the right-hand side of 
    the original grid to create a wider grid
    - Then, the order of columns in the appended grid segment is reversed.
    
    These steps are accomplished using Python's built-in list manipulation 
    capabilities and list comprehension to keep it concise and efficient.
    
    This function is designed to generalize well for any kind of token colors/IDs, 
    as long they're in a valid 2D list format.

    :param input_grid: 2D list of integers representing the input grid
    :return: Transformed 2D grid as per the operations mentioned above
